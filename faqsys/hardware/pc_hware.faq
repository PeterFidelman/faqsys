Q) 1.3  Is it ok to (sell/buy/job-offer/advertise) things here?

No, none of the above fit within the charter of the
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware.* hierarchy, therefore such posts are
considered unacceptable.  For buying/selling things, use groups with
the words 'wanted' or 'forsale', and for job offers, use groups with
the words 'jobs'.  All of these can be found in the misc.* hierarchy.
For commercial advertisements, use only the biz.* hierarchy as per the
guidelines of USENET.  (refer to the news.* groups for more
information).

Q) 1.4  Where should I post?

Q) 1.5  How come no one answers my questions?

If you don't give enough information when asking your question, then
people will not be able to answer it.  If you're not willing to take
the time to look up the necessary information, then why should you
expect people to take the time to answer your question?  For instance,
if you're asking a question about SCSI, it is very important to know
what type of SCSI host adapter (controller) you have.  Some other
important things to mention are which device drivers/tsr's you are
loading, what other similar devices you have in your system, and
exactly what in your setup has changed since it last worked.

Q) 1.6  What are the going prices for...?

If you're looking for new equipment, pick up a copy of Computer
Shopper.  This is the "bible" for buying new equipment.  Skim through
it for the best prices and give these distributers a call.  In most
cases, the advertisements must be placed months in advance; the actual
price may be even lower than the advertised price!  Two other things
to note are the warranty, return policy and location of the company
(companies within the same state as you may be required to add extra
sales taxes).

If you're looking for the expected price of used equipment, then scan
the newsgroup misc.forsale.computers.pc-clone for similar items.  This
will give you the best idea as what to expect.  Don't make assumptions
that the price of used equipment will follow the market trends of new
equipment.  For instance, when new memory prices nearly doubled, the
used prices were barely effected.

Q) 1.7  Who makes/Where can I find [some obscure piece of hardware]?
[From: uwvax!astroatc!nicmad!madnix!zaphod (Ron Bean)]

You can ask on the net, but you'll get a better response if you do
some investigating on your own first. Try calling vendors who
advertise similar or related hardware, they often have things that
aren't in the ads. Vendors who specialize in parts rather than
complete systems are a good bet. You can also ask local dealers to
check their wholesale sources.



Q) 1.8  What is the history of the IBM PC?
[From:]

Around 1978 and '79, the market served by IBM's Data Entry Systems
division began to change.  Instead of terminals and minicomputers or
mainframes, customers began demanding autonomous, low cost,
single-user computers with minimal compute power or connectivity, but
compliance to standards like the ASCII alphabet and the BASIC
programming language.  The closest product in IBM's line was the 5110,
a closed, BASIC-in-ROM machine with a tiny built-in character display.
The 5110 was uncompetitive, and IBM started losing bids from key
customers, mostly government agencies.

Data Entry commissioned a consulting firm (Boca Associates?) to design
a stop-gap machine to fill what was perceived within IBM as a
short-lived, specialized niche.  It was intended that the stop-gap
machine would only be offered for a couple of years until it would be
replaced in "The Product Line" by an internal IBM design.  Some IBM
executives believed the single-user desktop system was a fad which
would die out when the shortcomings of such systems became
appreciated.

The motherboard design was based very closely on a single-board
computer described in a 1978 (?) Intel application note.  (Anybody got
an original copy of this collector's item?  Among other things, Intel
argues that 640KB is more memory than single-user applications will
ever need, because of the efficiency of segmented memory
"management"!)  The expansion slot "bus" is based on an Intel bus
called Multibus 1, which Intel introduced in its microprocessor
software development equipment in the mid '70s.  The Monochrome and
Color Graphics Display Adapters are based on application notes for the
Motorola 6845 video controller chip, except that the strangely
interlaced pixel addresses in the CGA appears to have been extremely
short sighted.  The "event driven" keyboard is an original design, but
the concept is from the Xerox Alto and Star graphics workstations.
The keyboard noise and "feel" are intended to emulate those of the IBM
Selectric typewriter.  The Cassette Interface design is original, but
similar in concept to the one on the Radio Shack TRS-80.

Data Entry Division approached Digital Research Inc. to offer its
popular CP/M-86 operating system on the machine, but DRI rebuffed
them.  IBM's second choice was BASIC-in-ROM vendor Microsoft, which
had no OS product at the time but quickly purchased a crude disk
operating system called 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products to offer
it to IBM.  Its command interpreter was an imitation of Unix' Bourne
Shell, with the special characters changed to avoid infringing AT&T's
rights.

Data Entry Division began bidding this system in various State
procurements, without any plan to offer it to the public.

It became obvious that the Cassette Interface and optional 360KB
Flexible Disk Drive were inadequate.  The Cassette Interface was
dropped, and an optional Fixed Disk Drive offered on a revised model
known as the IBM Personal Computer XT.  (A fixed, or "hard" disk had
been offered on the PC by special order, with a Xebec controller, but
few were sold.)  The disk controller was designed around the Western
Digital 1010 chip, and its design is taken directly from a WD
application note.

The XT succeeded beyond all expectations.  IBM offered the system to
the public after it became clear that no other division was going to
come up with anything timely.  IBM published complete schematics and
ROM listings, encouraging clones.

In 1984, IBM introduced an upwardly compatible model based on the
Intel 80286.  The expansion slot "bus" was extended to 16-bit data
path width the same way Intel had extended Multibus: by adding data
and address bits, a signal for boards to announce their capability to
perform 16-bit transfers, and byte swapping on the motherboard to
support the 8-bit boards.

Q) 2.2  How do I pick the right processor?
[From: jabram@ichips.intel.com (Jeff Abramson)]

This is a hard question.  You have tradeoffs between price,
performance, compatibility, upgradebility, and power consumption.
As a desktop unit owner, you probably have less concerns about
power, but as a laptop owner, this is very important.

The frequency of the CPU defines how fast its internal clock runs.
This defines how fast instructions are executed.  In many ways, this
is meaningless, because a RISC machine (MIPS) running at 100MHz may
in reality be slower than a 50Mhz i486 because a RISC system must
execute more instructions to perform the same function (in some
cases).  Even when comparing processors in the same family, this
info can be misleading.  For example, an Intel486-25 is faster than
an AMD386-40, since the 486 has microarchitectural advancements over
the 386.  The same can be said for the Pentium, where a 66Mhz
Pentium is twice as fast as a 66MHz 486.

For compatibility, keep in mind that the Intel parts are the basis
for all of these processors.  Therefore you always run the risk that
an imitator's part may not be compatible.  AMD chips are compatible
because they are copied.  For some of you, these factors may be
important.

As far as upgradability goes, this depends on both your motherboard
and the processor.  If you purchase a 486DX, then you can upgrade to
a DX2 and double your internal clock simply by buying an overdrive
chip if your motherboard has the ZIF socket.  If it doesn't then you
can replace the CPU with a DX2.  Many new 486 motherboards contain
overdrive sockets for the not-yet-released Pentium chip that is pin
compatible.


Q) 2.3  What is the difference between the 386SX/386DX and 486SX/486DX?

[From: jabram@ichips.intel.com (Jeff Abramson)]

The Intel386DX contains full 32 bit buses for external data,
internal data, and address.  The Intel386SX contains a smaller 16
bit external data bus, and a smaller 24 bit address bus.

The Intel486DX contains a floating point unit, the Intel486SX does
not.  A common rumor is that the 486SX is simply a DX part that has
a failure in the floating point unit, so it has been disabled and
the part has been produces as an SX.  This was true for early
production parts and samples, but not for the mass produces SX parts
that we see today.  

Q) 2.4  What is a ZIF socket?

[From: jabram@ichips.intel.com (Jeff Abramson)]

ZIF stands for Zero Insertion Force, and describes a socket on your
motherboard that supports an upgrade processor (overdrive
processor).  In general, an overdrive upgrade works in conjunction
with your original processor so you cannot remove the original
processor after upgrade.  NOTE: Some motherboards do not have a ZIF
socket so you must replace the existing processor to upgrade.

Q) 2.5  What is over clocking and should I do it?
[From: jabram@ichips.intel.com (Jeff Abramson)]

Overclocking is a term generally used to describe how you have
increased the clock frequency on your board to run your system at a
higher speed.  For example, if you plug a 25MHz i486 into a board
that is configured to run a 33MHz i486, then you are overclocking
your CPU.  Most boards allow you to configure your clocking via
jumpers, and others require a new clock oscillator.

Although users have had success with overclocking, it is a dangerous
practice for two reasons.  First, the chip has been designed to meet
a certain speed.  Therefore, some circuits do not have the margin to
operate at a higher frequency.  The chips coming from a wafer have
various speed specs (statistical distribution), so you may be lucky
and own a CPU that has the circuit margins you need to overclock.
But you don't know - and if you overclock, you may get data failure.
The data failure may be reproducable - and therefore avoidable, but
most likely not.

Second, you have reliability concerns when overclocking.
Overclocking means faster frequency, which means more current and
power.  This can lead to real failures in your CPU.
Electromigration is one such failure where metal lines in your CPU
will actually break or connect if they get too much current.  This
is irreversable, and most likely not covered under warranty.

So when can you overclock?  Really only if you don't care about
burning out your CPU and you don't care if you get wrong data every
now and then.  If you own a machine and you use it just for games,
then overclocking may be something to try - and you simply upgrade
to a new CPU when you burn out the current one.  Otherwise, it's not
worth the small performance gain.


Q) 2.6  Which is faster, a DX-50 or DX2-66

The two processors are relatively close for overall usage.  The DX-50
has more I/O bandwidth and the DX2-66 has more computational power.

Q) 2.7  *What is the P24T/Overdrive?
Q) 2.8  What are the differences between the 80x87 co-processors?

See reference in: "What are the differences between the 80x86 CPUs?"

Q) 2.9  Would a math co-processor speed up my machine?

[From: jruchak@mtmis1.mis.semi.harris.com (John Anthony Ruchak)]

If you do a lot of number-crunching with CAD/CAM applications,
spreadsheets, and the like, a math co-processor is likely to increase
performance.  If on the other hand, your primary work is word
processing, a math co-processor will have barely any effect at all.
Also, a math co-processor will not provide any benefit if your CPU
already has one built-in (486/586-DX chips).  In addition, a math
co-processor is not likely to improve the over-all performance of
Microsoft Windows, except when you are running the afore-mentioned
number-crunching programs.

Q) 2.10  Can I use a x387 with my 486?

[From: Shaun Burnett (burnesa@cat.com)]

No, they are not pin compatible.  The 486DX and above contain an
on-chip floating point unit. Therefore, a 387 (SX or DX) math
coprocessor is not needed.  All software written for a 387 coprocessor
will run on your 486.
 
If you want a math coprocessor for a 486SX, you need to purchase the
487SX or a 486 Overdrive processor.
 
While we're talking about math coprocessors, I'll make a brief note
about the Weitek.  Some motherboards may have a socket for a Weitek
math coprocessor.  These coprocessors are not compatible with the
Intel 387 math coprocessor and should only be used if your software
requires it.  The Weitek 3167 replaced the Weitek 1167 and is for the
386 while the Weitek 4167 is for a 486.

Q) 2.11  What is the floating point (FDIV) problem with the Pentium?

Under certain circumstances, based on divisor ranges, mantissa bit 13
and beyond can be incorrect during floating point division.  This
problem effects the functions:

    FDIV, FDIVR, FPTAN, FPATAN, FPREM and FPREM1

in single, double and extended precision modes.  Many programs and
operating systems are already incorporating software patches to work
around the problem.  For most users, the accuracy supplied by the
Pentium even without a patch is more than enough.  However, since the
media hype made the problem sound like it would have a serious impact
on everyone, Intel has agreed to replace all faulty Pentiums free of
charge.

Q) 2.12  How can I tell if my Pentium has the FDIV bug?

If you purchased your Pentium in 1994 or earlier, chances are near
100% that it has the problem.  Purchasing it after this date does not
guarantee a bug free CPU.  The problem existed in all speed grades.

The program:

ftp.intel.com:/pub/IAL/pentium/cpuidf.exe    - executable
ftp.intel.com:/pub/IAL/pentium/cpuidf.txt    - instructions

is Intel's official program to identify CPUs with the FDIV bug.  This
program uses the CPU ID register to compare against the list of known
buggy Pentiums rather than attempting to reproduce the bug through
software, so it should be accurate even if the OS has a software FDIV
patch already in place.
 
Q) 2.13  How do I get a replacement for my buggy Pentium?

From the US and Canada, call 1-800-628-8686.  For other countries, see
the file:

 ftp.intel.com:/pub/IAL/pentium/cpusup.txt

Be sure to have your credit card handy.  Intel won't place any charges
on it as long as you return the defective Pentium within 30 days.  If
you don't have a credit card, contact Intel and they will refer you to
a local service center.

Q) 2.14  Memory terminology, what does it mean?
[From: cls@truffula.sj.ca.us (Cameron L. Spitzer)]

Read/write memory in computers is implemented using Random Access Memory
chips (RAMs).  RAMs are also used to store the displayed image in a video
board, to buffer frames in a network controller or sectors in a disk
controller, etc.  RAMs are sold by their size (in bits), word width (how
many bits can you access in one cycle), and access time (how fast you
can read a location), among other characteristics.


SRAMs and DRAMs
---------------
RAMs can be classified into two types: "static" and "dynamic."

In a static RAM, each bit is represented by the state of a circuit
with two stable states.  Such a "bistable" circuit can be built with four
transistors (for maximum density) or six (for highest speed and lowest
power).  Static RAMs (SRAMs) are available in many configurations.
(Almost) all SRAMs have one pin per address line, and all of them
are able to store data for as long as power is applied, without any
external circuit activity.

In a dynamic RAM (DRAM), each bit is represented by the charge on a
*very* small (30-50 femptofarads) capacitor, which is built into a
single, specialized transistor.  DRAM storage cells take only about
a quarter of the silicon area that SRAM cells take, and silicon
area translates into cost.
The cells in a DRAM are organized into rows and columns.  To access
a bit, you first select its row, and then you select its column.
Unfortunately, the charge leaks off the capacitor over time,
so each cell must be periodically "refreshed" by reading it and
writing it back.  This happens automatically whenever a row is accessed.
After you're finished accessing a row, you have to give the DRAM time
to copy the row of bits back to the cells: the "precharge" time.

Because the row and column addresses are not needed at the same
time, they share the same pins.  This makes the DRAM package smaller
and cheaper, but it makes the problem of distributing the signals
in the memory array difficult, because the timing becomes so
critical.  Signal integrity in the memory array is one of the
things that differentiate a lousy motherboard from a high quality
one.

SIMMs and SIPPs
---------------
Through the 1970s, RAMs were shipped in tubes, and the board makers
soldered them into boards or plugged them into sockets on boards.
This became a problem when end-users started installing their own
RAMs, because the leads ("pins") were too delicate.  Also, the
individual dual in-line package (DIP) sockets took up too much board
area.
In the early 1980s, DRAM manufacturers began offering DRAMs on tiny
circuit boards which snap into special sockets, and by the late '80s
these "single in-line memory modules" (SIMMs) had become the most popular
DRAM packaging.  Board vendors who didn't trust the new SIMM sockets
used modules with pins: single inline pinned packages (SIPPs),
which plug into sockets with more traditional pin receptacles.

PC-compatibles store each byte in main memory with an associated
check bit, or "parity bit."  That's why you add memory in multiples
of nine bits.  The most common SIMMs present nine bits of data at
each cycle (we say they're "nine bits wide") and have thirty contact
pads, or "leads."  (The leads are commonly called "pins" in the trade,
although "pads" is a more appropriate term.  SIMMs don't *have* pins!)

At the high end of the PC market, "36 bit wide" SIMMs with 72 pads
are gaining popularity.  Because of their wide data path, 36-bit SIMMs
give the motherboard designer more configuration options (you can
upgrade in smaller chunks) and allow bandwidth-enhancing tricks
(i.e. interleaving) which were once reserved for larger machines.
Another advantage of 72-lead SIMMs is that four of the leads are used
to tell the motherboard how fast the RAMs are, so it can configure
itself automatically.  (I do not know whether the current crop of
motherboards takes advantage of this feature.)

"3-chip" and "9-chip" SIMMs

In 1988 and '89, when 1 megabit (1Mb) DRAMs were new, manufacturers
had to pack nine RAMs onto a 1 megabyte (1MB) SIMM.  Now (1993) 4Mb DRAMs
are the most cost-effective size.  So a 1MB SIMM can be built with
two 4Mb DRAMs (configured 1M x4) plus a 1Mb (x1) for the check-bit.

VRAMs
-----
In graphics-capable video boards, the displayed image is almost
always stored in DRAMs.  Access to this data must be shared between
the hardware which continuously copies it to the display device (this
process is called "display refresh" or "video refresh") and
the CPU.  Most boards do it by time-sharing ordinary, single-port
DRAMs.  But the faster, more expensive boards use specialized DRAMs
which are equipped with a second data port whose function is tailored
to the display refresh operation.  These "Video DRAMs" (VRAMs) 
have a few extra pins and command a price premium.  They nearly double
the bandwidth available to the CPU or graphics engine.

(As far as I know, the first dual-ported DRAMs were built by Four-
Phase Systems Inc., in 1970, for use in their "IV-70" minicomputers, which
had integrated video.  The major DRAM vendors started offering VRAMs
in about 1983 [Texas Instruments was first], and workstation vendors
snapped them up.  They made it to the PC trade in the late '80s.)

Speed
-----
DRAMs are characterized by the time it takes to read a word,
measured from the row address becoming valid to the data coming out.
This parameter is called Row Access Time, or tRAC.  There are many
other timing parameters to a DRAM, but they scale with tRAC
remarkably well.  tRAC is measured in nanoseconds (ns).
A nanosecond is one billionth (10 e-9) of a second.

It's so difficult to control the semiconductor fabrication processes,
that the parts don't all come out the same.  Instead, their performance
varies widely, depending on many factors.  A RAM design which would
yield 50 ns tRAC parts if the fab were always tuned perfectly, instead 
yields a distribution of parts from 80 to 50.  When the plant is new,
it may turn out mostly nominal 70 ns parts, which may actually deliver 
tRAC between 60.1 ns and 70.0 ns, at 70 or 85 degrees Celcius and
4.5 volts power supply.  As it gets tuned up, it may turn out mostly 60 
ns parts and a few 50s and 70s.  When it wears out it may get less 
accurate and start yielding more 70s again.

RAM vendors have to test each part off the line to see how fast it is.  
An accurate, at-speed DRAM tester can cost several million dollars, and 
testing can be a quarter of the cost of the parts.  The finished parts 
are not marked until they are tested and their speed is known.



Q) 2.15  What happen to my 384k?

The memory between 640k and 1Meg is used for the BIOS, the video
aperture, and a number of other things.  With the proper memory
manager, DOS can take advantage of it.  Many systems, however, won't
identify its existence on boot.  This does not mean it isn't there.

Q) 2.16  How do I tell how big/fast my SIMMs are?

Individual DRAMs are marked with their speed after they are tested.
The mark is usually a suffix to the part number, representing tens of
nanoseconds.  Thus, a 511024-7 on a SIMM is very likely a 70 ns DRAM.
(vendor numbering scheme table to be added)

Q) 2.17  What speed SIMMs do I need?

[From: cls@truffula.sj.ca.us (Cameron L. Spitzer)]

There is no reliable formula for deriving the required RAM speed from
the clock rate or wait states on the motherboard.  Do not buy a
motherboard that doesn't come with a manual that clearly specifies
what speed SIMMs are required at each clock rate.  You can always
substitute *faster* SIMMs for the ones that were called out in the
manual.  If you are investing in a substantial quantity of RAM,
consider buying faster than you need on the chance you can keep it
when you get a faster CPU.

That said, most 25 MHz and slower motherboards work fine with 80 ns
parts, most 33 MHz boards and some 40 MHz boards were designed for
70 ns parts, and some 40 MHz boards and everything faster require
60 ns or faster.  Some motherboards allow programming extra wait states
to allow for slower parts, but some of these designs do not really relax
all the critical timing requirements by doing that.  It's much
safer to use DRAMs that are fast enough for the no-wait or one-wait
cycles at the top end of the motherboard's capabilities.

Q) 2.18  Will 9 chip and 3 chip SIMMs work together?

[From: cls@truffula.sj.ca.us (Cameron L. Spitzer)]

Almost always.  But there are exceptions.

1.  Some motherboards do not supply enough refresh address bits for a
4Mb x1 or a 1Mb x4 DRAM.  These old motherboards will not work with 4
MB 9-chip SIMMs or 1 MB 3-chip SIMMS.

2.  Some EL CHEAPO motherboards do not have proper terminations on the
lines which drive the DRAM array.  These boards may show only marginal
compatibility with various SIMMs, not working with all prefectly good
SIMMs you try, favoring SIMMs with parameters skewed towards one end
or another of the allowed ranges.  In some cases, most of the SIMMs
you happen to try might be 9-chip modules, and in other cases they
might be 3-chip modules.  A random selection of a dozen SIMMs might
lead you to conclude the motherboard doesn't "work" with 3-chip
modules, or with a "mixture" of 3-chip and 9-chip modules.

You might find the real solution is to use SIMMs one speed faster
than the manual calls for, because the particular motherboard design
just cuts too many things too close.

Q) 2.19  What are "single-sided" and "double-sided" 72-pin SIMMs?

[From: uwvax!astroatc!nicmad!madnix!zaphod (Ron Bean)]
 
   All 72-pin SIMMs are 32 bits wide (36 with parity), but
double-sided SIMMs have four RAS (Row Address Strobe) lines instead of
two. This can be thought of as two single-sided SIMMs wired in
parallel. But since there is only one set of data lines, you can only
access one "side" at a time.
 
   Usually, 1Mb, 4Mb, and 16Mb 72-pin SIMMs are single-sided, and 2Mb,
8Mb, and 32Mb SIMMs are double-sided. This only refers to how the
chips are wired-- SIMMs that are electrically "single-sided" may have
chips on both sides of the board.
 
   Most 486 motherboards use memory in banks of 32 bits (plus parity),
and may treat a double-sided SIMM as "two banks" (see your
motherboard's manual for details). Some can take four SIMMs if they're
single-sided, but only two if they're double-sided. Others can take
four of either type.
 
   Pentium (and some 486) motherboards use pairs of 72-pin SIMMs for
64-bit memory. Since double-sided SIMMs can only access 32 bits at a
time, you still need to use them in pairs to make 64 bits.


Q) 2.20  +How do you distinguish between parity and non-parity SIMMs?

The precise method is to count the number and type of each chip (after
looking them up in a databook for that DRAM manufacturer).  However,
you can get a good guess just by counting the number of chips.

DRAMs (for PC SIMMs) are either 1 or 4 bits wide.  The total bit width
is 8 or 9 (for 30 pin SIMMs) and 32 or 36 (for 72 pin SIMMs).  DRAMs
to hold parity are usually 1 bit wide to allow byte writes.  Some
examples:

2 chips: 8 bit (2x4bit) - no parity
3 chips: 9 bit (2x4bit + 1x1bit) - parity
8 chips: 8 bit (8x1bit) or 32 bit (8x4bit) - no parity
9 chips: 9 bit (9x1bit) - parity
12 chips: 36 bit (8x4bit + 4x1bit) - parity

Some new 72 pin SIMMs have two 32 (or 36) bit banks per SIMM and
therefore have double the number of chips as a normal SIMM.

It also seems that some cheap SIMMs have begun using 'fake' parity on
SIMMs; XOR gates that generate parity from 8 bit data rather than
store and recall the actual parity generated by the DRAM controller.
The only way to tell if you've been taken by one of these fake parity
SIMMs is to look up all of the suspected parts in a DRAM databook.


Q) 2.21  Can I use Mac or PS/2 SIMMs in my PC?

Yes, just about all SIMMs are compatible, be they from another
personal computer, a mainframe, or even a laser printer, though are a
few some odd systems out there.  There are three significant issues:
speed, parity and number of pins (data width).  Speed is obvious,
check the rating, ie: 70ns, to make sure they meet the minimum
requirements of your system.  Parity either exists or doesn't exist
and can be identified by an extra bit per byte, ie: 9 bits or 36 bits.
If your system does not require parity, you can still use SIMMs with
parity.  If, however, your system does require parity, you can't use
SIMMs without parity.  For this case, many PC's have an option to
disable the parity requirement via a jumper or BIOS setting; refer to
your motherboard manual.  The final issue is the number of pins on the
SIMM; the two most common are 30 pins (8 or 9 bit SIMMs) and 72 pins
(32 or 36 bit SIMMs); the second is physically larger thus the one can
not be used in the other.  A few motherboards have both types of
sockets.

Q) 2.22  What do wait states and burst rates in my BIOS mean?

[From: cls@truffula.sj.ca.us (Cameron L. Spitzer)]

Modern motherboards are equipped with variable clocks and features
for tuning board performance at each speed.  The BIOS knows how to
program the register bits which control these options.

1.  Wait states may be adjustable to allow for slower DRAMs or
cache RAMs.  If you don't have a motherboard manual, or it doesn't
say, then you will just have to experiment.
2.  Sometimes a wait or two on a write is required with write-through
cache.  The programming allows for slower DRAMs.  The extra wait
state may cost you enough time that you would do better running at a
slower clock rate where the wait state is not required.
3.  Burst rates refer to the number of wait states inserted for
each longword access in the cache fill cycle.

Bob Nichols (rnichols@ihlpm.ih.att.com) adds:
These numbers refer to the number of clock cycles for each access of a
"burst mode" memory read.  The fastest a 486 can access memory is 2 clock
cycles for the first word and 1 cycle for each subsequent word, so
"2-1-1-1" corresponds to "zero wait states."  Anything else is slower.

How fast you can go depends on the external clock speed of your CPU, the
access time of your cache SRAMs, and the design of the cache controller.
It can also be affected by the amount of cache equipped, since "x-1-1-1"
is generally dependent on having 2 banks of cache SRAMs so that the
accesses can be interleaved.  With a 50MHz bus (486DX-50), few
motherboards can manage "2-1-1-1" no matter how fast the SRAMs are.  At
33MHz or less (486DX-33, 486DX2-66), many motherboards can achieve
"2-1-1-1" if the cache SRAMs are fast enough and there are 2 banks
equipped (cache sizes of 64KB or 256KB, typically).

Q) 2.23  Cache terminology, what does it mean?
[From: cls@truffula.sj.ca.us (Cameron L. Spitzer)]

Why cache improves performance
------------------------------
Today's microprocessors ("uPs") need a faster memory than can be made
with economical DRAMs.  So we provide a fast SRAM buffer
between the DRAM and the uP.  The most popular way to set it up is
by constructing a "direct mapped cache," which is the only setup
I'll describe here.


Generic motherboard cache architecture
--------------------------------------
The direct mapped cache has three big features:
1. a "data store" made with fast SRAMs,
2  a "tag store" made with even faster SRAMs, and
3. a comparator.

The data store is the chunk of RAM you see in the motherboard price
lists.  It holds "blocks" or "lines" of data recently used by the CPU.
Lines are almost always 16 bytes.  The address feeding the cache is
simply the least significant part of the address feeding main memory.
Each memory location can be cached in only one location in the data
store.

There are two "policies" for managing the data store.  Under the
"write-back" (or "copy-back") policy, the master copy of the data is
in cache, and main memory locations may be "stale" at times.  Under
"write-through", writes go immediately to main memory as well as to
cache and memory is never "stale."

The tag store mantains one "word" of information about each line of
data in the data store.
In a "write-back" or "copy-back" cache, the tag word contains two items:
1.  the part of the main memory address that was *not*
    fed to the data store, and
2.  a "dirty" bit.

A write-through cache doesn't need a dirty bit.  The tag store is
addressed with the most significant address bits that are being fed to
the data store.  The tag is only concerned with the address bits that
are used to select a line.  With a 16 byte line, address bits 0
through 3 are irrelevant to the tag.

An example: The motherboard has 32 MB main memory and 256 KB cache.
To specify a byte in main memory, 25 bits of address are required: A0
through A24.  To specify a byte in data store, 18 bits (A0 through
A17) are required.  Lines in cache are 16 bytes on 16 byte boundaries,
so only A3 through A17 are required to specify a line.  The tag word
for this system would represent A18 through A24 (plus dirty bit).  The
tag store in this system would be addressed by A3 through A17,
therefore the tag store would require 16 K tag words seven bits wide.
The dirty bit is written at different times than the rest of the tag,
so it might be housed separately, and this tag store might be built in
three 16K x4 SRAMs.

What happens when it runs
-------------------------
Each motherboard memory cycle begins when the uP puts out a memory
address.  The data store begins fetching, and simultaneously the
tag begins fetching.  When the tag word is ready, the Comparator
compares the tag word to the current address.

If they match, a cache hit is declared and the uP reads or writes
the data store location.  If the hit is a write, the copy-back
cache marks the line "dirty" by setting its dirty-bit in the line's
tag word.  The write-through motherboard simultaneously stores the
write data in data store and begins a DRAM write cycle.  The uP
moves on.

If the tag word doesn't match, what a bummer, it's a cache miss.
If the line in cache is dirty, double bummer, the line must be
copied back to main memory before anything else can happen.  All
16 bytes are copied back, even if the hit was a one-byte write.
This data transfer is called a "dirty write flush."

On a read-miss, the motherboard has to copy a line from main memory
to cache (and update the tag, the whole operation is called a "cache
fill"), and the uP can stop waiting as soon as the bytes it wants
go by.  On a write-miss, the caches I've worked with ignore the
event (that's an oversimplification) and the main memory performs
a write cycle.  I've heard of systems that fill on a write-miss,
that is they replace the cache line whenever it misses, read or
write, dirty or not.  I've never seen such a system.

Terms
-----
The 486, the 68020, and their descendants have caches on chip.
We call the on-chip cache "primary" and the cache on the
motherboard "secondary."  The 386 has no cache, therefore the cache
on a 386 motherboard is "primary."  I like to call the DRAM array
"core" for brevity.  Motherboard = "mb."  Megabyte = "MB."

Problems

I added "core" and I had to disable my secondary cache to
get the board running.  Or, I added core and performance took a dive.
Disabling secondary cache improved it, but still real slow.
What happened?

 Whenever you are adding memory and you cross a power-of-2
address boundary, another address bit becomes interesting to the
tag.  That is, the tag does not care when you add your 8th MB
(MB) but it cares a lot about the new address bit 24 when you add
your 9th MB, or your 17th (bit 25).  Evidently, at the low-price
end of the mb market there are boards with not enough tag RAM
sockets to support all the core they can hold.  Most of these EL
CHEAPO mbs don't even try to use cache in the region beyond the
tag's coverage.  Some of them don't have the logic to stay out or
the BIOS doesn't know to enable it.  These boards just don't run
right.

Do not buy a mb if you are not sure it can cache all of core.  The
worst case is with core fully stuffed with whatever the board claims
to hold, and the smallest cache configuration.  Some motherboards
ask you to add cache when you add core, so that they don't have to
provide for that worst case tag width.  These motherboards may ask
you to move some jumpers in the tag area.  The jumpers control
which address bits the tag looks at.  Do not buy a motherboard if
you don't know how to set all the jumpers.



Q) 2.24  How do I upgrade the size of my cache?

Look in your motherboard manual.  Each motherboard is different.
You will have to add or replace cache RAMs and move jumpers.

Q) 2.25  Do I need to fill the "dirty tag" RAM socket on my motherboard?

[From: cls@truffula.sj.ca.us (Cameron L. Spitzer)]

Perhaps you don't *have* to for the board to run, but the missing RAM
will cost you performance.  Most "write-back" mbs cope with the
missing RAM by treating all lines as dirty.  You get a lot of
unneccessary write cycles; you might even do better with
write-through.

Your bargain-basement no-documentation no-brand mb might not have the
pullup resistor on that socket, and it might run for a second, ten
minutes, or ten years with that pin not driven.  I think it's a
pointless risk to leave the socket empty.

Q) 2.26  How fast do my cache RAMs have to be?

[From: cls@truffula.sj.ca.us (Cameron L. Spitzer)]

Only the person who designed your mb knows for sure.  There is
no simple formula related to clock rate.  However, most people tell
me their 33 MHz mbs' manuals call for 25 ns data store and 20 ns
tag store, and their 40 and 50 MHz mbs want 20 ns data store and
15 or 12 ns tag.  Tqhe tag has to be faster than data store to make
time for the comparator to work.  Do not buy a motherboard if you do
not know what speed and size of cache RAMs it requires in all its
speeds and configurations.

If you're not sure, it doesn't hurt to use faster RAMs than your
manual calls for.  If your manual says 20 ns for location x and you
happen to have 15 ns parts, it's ok to "mix" the speeds.  It's ok to
"mix" RAMs from more than one manufacturer.  However, the faster RAMs
will not buy you more performance.

Q) 2.27  Which is the best cache policy, write-through or "write-back?"

[From: cls@truffula.sj.ca.us (Cameron L. Spitzer)]

For most applications, copy-back gives better performance than
write-through.  The amount of win will depend on your application and
may not be significant.  Write-through is simpler, but not by much any
more.

Q) 2.28  What about an n-way set associative cache, isn't it better?

[From: cls@truffula.sj.ca.us (Cameron L. Spitzer)]

At the high end of the mb market, caches are available with more than
one set.  In these caches, the data store is broken into two or four
parts, or sets, with a separate tag for each.  On a miss, clever
algorithms (such as Least Recently Used) can be used to pick which set
will be filled, because each set has a candidate location.  The result
is a higher hit rate than a direct mapped (single set) cache the same
size can offer.

The primary cache on the 486 is four-way set associative.

Q) 2.29  Which is better, ISA/EISA/VLB/PCI/etc?
[From: ralf@wpi.wpi.edu (Ralph Valentino)]

Here is a quick overview of the various bus architectures available
for the PC and some of the strengths and weaknesses of each.  Some
terms are described in more detail at the bottom.

XT bus:
	8 data bits, 20 address bits
	4.77 MHz
   Comments: Obsolete, very similar to ISA bus, many XT cards will
             work in ISA slots.
	
ISA bus: Industry Standard Architecture bus (aka. AT bus)
	8/16 data bits, 24 address bits (16Meg addressable)
	8-8.33MHz, asynchronous
	5.55M/s burst
	bus master support
	edge triggered TTL interrupts (IRQs) - no sharing
	low cost
   Comments: ideal for low to mid bandwidth cards, though lack of
	     IRQs can quickly become annoying.
	
MCA bus: Micro Channel Architecture bus
	16/32 data bit, 32 address bits
	80M/s burst, synchronous
	full bus master capability
	good bus arbitration
	auto configurable
	IBM proprietary (not ISA/EISA/VLB compatible)
   Comments: Since MCA was proprietary, EISA was formed to compete with
             it.  EISA gained much more acceptance; MCA is all but dead.
	
EISA bus: Enhanced Industry Standard Architecture bus
	32 data bits, 32 address bits
	8-8.33MHz, synchronous
	32M/s burst (sustained)
	full bus master capability
	good bus arbitration
	auto configurable
	sharable IRQs, DMA channels
	backward compatible with ISA
	some acceptance outside of the PC architecture
	high cost
   Comments: EISA is great for high bandwidth bus mastering cards
             such as SCSI host adaptors, but its high cost limits
             its usefulness for other types of cards.

P-EISA: Pragmatic EISA (also Super-ISA)
	(see the description of the HiNT chipset elsewhere in this FAQ)

VLB: VESA Local Bus
	32 data bits, 32 address bits
	25-40MHz, asynchronous
	130M/s burst (sustained is closer to 32M/s)
	bus master capability
	will coexist with ISA/EISA
	slot limited to 2 or 3 cards typical
	backward compatible with ISA
	moderate cost
   Comments: VLB is great for video cards, but its lack of a good bus
             arbiter limits its usefulness for bus mastering cards and
             its moderate cost limits its usefulness for low to mid 
             bandwidth cards.  Since it can coexist with EISA/ISA, a
             combination of all three types of cards usually works best.
             
PCI:  Peripheral Component Interconnect local bus
	32 data bits (64 bit option), 32 address bits (64 bit option)
	up to 33MHz, synchronous
	132M/s burst (sustained) (264M/s with 64 bit option)
	full bus master capability
	good bus arbitration
	slot limited to 3 or 4 cards typical
	auto configurable
	will coexist with ISA/EISA/MCA as well as another PCI bus
	strong acceptance outside of the PC architecture
	moderate cost
   Comments: The newest of the buses, combining the speed of VLB with
             the advanced arbitration of EISA.  Great for both video
	     cards and bus mastering SCSI/network cards.

			=Terms=

Auto configurable:  Allows software to identify the board's
requirements and resolve any potential resource conflicts
(IRQ/DMA/address/BIOS/etc).

Bus master support:  Capable of First Party DMA transfers.

Full bus master capability:  Can support any First Party cycle from any
device, including another CPU.

Good bus arbitration:  Fair bus access during conflicts, no need to
back off unless another device needs the bus.  This prevents CPU
starvation while allowing a single device to use 100% of the available
bandwidth.  Other buses let a card hold the bus until it decides to
release it and attempts to prevent starvation by having an active card
voluntarily release the bus periodically ("bus on time") and remain
off the bus for a period of time ("bus off time") to give other
devices, including the CPU, a chance even if they don't want it.

16Meg addressable:  This limits first party DMA transfers to the lower
16 Meg of address space.  There are various software methods to
overcome this problem when more than 16 Megs of main memory are
available.  This has no effect on the ability of the processor to
reach all of main memory.

Backward compatible with ISA:  Allows you to place an ISA card in the
slot of a more advanced bus.  Note, however, that the ISA card does
not get any benefit from being in an advanced slot, instead, the slot
reverts to an ISA slot.  Other slots are unaffected.



Q) 2.30  *What are the (dis)advantages of ISA/VLB/EISA SCSI?

Q) 2.31  Will an ISA card work in an MCA (PS/2) machine?

No, they will not.  MCA, unlike EISA and VLB, is not backward
compatible with ISA.

Q) 2.32  What does the "chip set" do?
[From: cls@truffula.sj.ca.us (Cameron L. Spitzer)]

The motherboard "chip set" contains all the logic that's not in
the microprocessor ("uP") and its coprocessor, or the memory.
These functions always include:
 *  Address decoding and "memory mapping"
 *  keyboard interface controller (which includes reset generator)
 *  Direct Memory Access (DMA) channels
 *  interrupt controller
 *  bus controller(s)
 *  battery-powered "real time" clock/calendar circuit
 *  crystal-controlled clock oscillator(s)
 *  main memory controller
 
They almost always include:
 *  controller for cache external to the uP
 *  "turbo" switch logic
 *  programmable "wait state" logic

and some of them include:
 *  controller(s) for PCMCIA slots
 *  "green" power-conservation logic
 *  video display logic for CRT, LCD, or both
 *  serial ports, parallel ports, floppy, SCSI and/or IDE, etc. controllers
 *  network interface controllers (for Ethernet)

Some people consider the BIOS ROM part of the "chip set."

Sometimes part of an EISA or VLB bus controller is implemented
in an optional, socketed integrated circuit.  A motherboard like that
can be sold with the socket empty, and you have to go back and
buy the "bus mastering option" later when you find out you need it.

"Chip sets" are usually a set of highly integrated, special purpose
integrated circuits.  The keyboard interface controller is usually
in a 40-pin dual-inline pin (DIP) package compatible with the Intel
8048 single-chip microcomputer which was used for that function in the
IBMPC-AT.  The rest of the logic often fits in a single IC.  In the trade,
you may see this single IC referred to as "the chipset," even though
the keyboard interface and other logic is external.  The Asian data sheets
often call the high-integration chips "LSIs."

The word "ChipSet" is a trademark of Chips and Technologies
Inc. (San Jose, California), which introduced a 5-chip set of LSIs
for AT-clone motherboards in early 1985.  CTI may also own "chipset"
and "Chipset"; I don't know.
CTI was very successful at promoting the term "ChipSet," but less
successful at associating it in the public mind with their particular
brand.  People use the word to refer to any high integration chip
used in PCs.  For example, you'll hear people talk about the "ET4000
video chipset."  The ET4000 is a single chip which integrates most
of an SVGA controller.  The word "ASIC" (application-specific integrated
circuit) would be more appropriate.

Single, high-integration ICs are not very good at driving heavily
loaded signals, like the ones in the memory array and the expansion
slots.  Better motherboards use buffer chips external to the LSI
for this electrical function.  It may not show up in "WinMark"
comparisons, but it shows in electrical compatibility.  Well-buffered
motherboards are less likely to require SIMM "cherry-picking,"
and are more likely to work at high ambient temperatures.
The 74F245, which costs about 15 cents in high volume, is often used for
this electrical buffering.



Q) 2.33  +How do I enter the CMOS configuration menu?

[From: burnesa@cat.com (Shaun Burnet)]

        AMI BIOS        Del key during the POST
        Award BIOS      Ctrl-Alt-Esc
        DTK BIOS        Esc key during the POST
        IBM PS/2 BIOS   Ctrl-Alt-Ins after Ctrl-Alt-Del
        Phoenix BIOS    Ctrl-Alt-Esc or Ctrl-Alt-S

[From: mike@pencom.com (Mike Heath)]

Some 286 machines don't have a CMOS configuration menu in the BIOS.
They require a software CMOS setup program.  If you don't have the
Installation and/or Diagnostics diskette for your machine, you can
try using a shareware/freeware program.  Try looking in:

oak.oakland.edu:/SimTel/msdos/at
  or
ftp.uu.net:/systems/msdos/simtel/at


Q) 2.34  What is bus mastering and how do I know if I have it?

Bus mastering is the ability of an expansion (ISA/EISA/VLB/MCA/etc)
card to directly read and write to main memory.  This allows the CPU
do delegate I/O work out to the cards, freeing it to do other things.
For all of the above busses, bus mastering capability is assumed.
Unless specifically stated otherwise, you should assume each slot has
this capability.  For cards, this is not assumed.  If you want a bus
mastering card, you should specifically request it and expect to pay
more.  Note that some cards (RLL/MFM/IDE/com) are not available in bus
mastering versions.

Q) 2.35  Can I put an ISA cards in EISA or VLB slots?

Yes, you can put ISA cards in both EISA slots and VLB slots, as both
buses were specifically designed to be 100% ISA compatible.  ISA cards
will not directly effect the performance of EISA/VLB cards; a well
balanced system will have both.  Note, however, that the total
bandwidth of the bus will be split between all cards, so there is a
strong advantage to using EISA/VLB cards for the high bandwidth
devices (disk/video).

Q) 2.36  How should I configure ISA/VLB cards in the EISA config utility?

Only EISA cards matter in the ECU; ISA and VLB entries are only place
markers.  While this is a good way to keep track of IRQ, DMA and BIOS
conflictions, ISA and VLB need not be placed in the configuration at
all, nor should it be assumed that the settings for them match the
actual card settings.  If you wish to add them, you can use the
"Generic ISA Card" configuration file for either.  Do not expect card
vendors to supply them.

Q) 2.37  What is the difference between EISA Standard and Enhanced modes?

Many EISA cards support both Standard (ISA) and Enhanced (EISA) modes.
In Standard mode, the card will appear to be an ISA card to the OS; it
will generate edge triggered interrupts and only accept ISA addressing
(for bus mastering cards), for instance.  An important thing to note
is that the card may still do EISA specific things like 32-bit data
bus mastering and EISA configuration setup as this functionality is
hidden from the OS.

Q) 2.38  Is there any point in putting more than 16M in an ISA machine?

[From: cls@truffula.sj.ca.us (Cameron L. Spitzer)]

Sure.  Even inferior operating systems can use it for something.
The question is how much performance it buys.  In ISA, the DMA
channels and bus-mastering IO cards can only address the first 16 MB.  
Therefore the device drivers have to copy data up and down or just
not use the space.  I am told the Linux SCSI drivers know how to
do this.  I don't know about OS/2 or MSWindows.

Q) 2.39  What disadvantages are there to the HiNT EISA chip set?
[From: ralf@wpi.wpi.edu (Ralph Valentino)]

The HiNT Caesar Chip Set (CS8001 & CS8002) can come in three different
configurations.  All three of these configurations have EISA style
connectors and are (sometimes incorrectly) sold as EISA motherboards.
The differences should be carefully noted, though.

The rarest of these configuration uses a combination of the first HiNT
chip (CS8001) and the Intel chip set.  This configuration can support
the full EISA functionality: 32 address bits, 32 data bits, level
sensitive (sharable) interrupts, full EISA DMA, watch dog (sanity)
timer, and so forth.

The second configuration is called Super-ISA, which uses both of the
HiNT chips.  This configuration is very common in low-end models.  It
supports a very limited functionality: 24 address bits, 32 data bits,
edge triggered (non-sharable) interrupts, ISA (16 data, 24 address)
DMA, and no watch dog timer.  Some EISA boards, such as the Adaptec
1742A EISA Fast SCSI-2 host adapter, can be configured to work in this
mode by hacking their EISA configuration file (.CFG) to turn off these
features.  Other EISA cards require these features and are therefore
unusable in these systems.

The final configuration is called Pragmatic EISA, or P-EISA.  Like
Super-ISA, both HiNT chips are used but external support logic
(buffers and such) are added to provide a somewhat increased
functionality: 32 address bits, 32 data bits, edge triggered
(non-sharable) interrupts, ISA (16 data, 24 address) DMA, and no watch
dog timer.  The full 32 bits for address and data allow bus mastering
devices access to the complete range of main memory.  As with
Super-ISA, there may be incompatibilities with some EISA cards.



Q) 2.40  *Should I change the ISA bus speed?

Q) 2.41  Why is my PC's clock so inaccurate?
[From: uwvax!astroatc!nicmad!madnix!zaphod (Ron Bean)]
 
Usually this means that the clock crystal is not adjusted properly, or
that it needs a new battery. The interrupt-based "DOS time" can also
be affected by programs that disable interrupts for too long.
 
   If your clock is just running at the wrong speed, you can
compensate for it in software by measuring the drift rate and applying
a correction factor. In the long run, this can be *very* accurate. One
such program for DOS is adclk100.zip. An alternative is to run a
program that periodically sets your clock to another one that's known
to be accurate (see the question on setting your clock).
 
   If your clock is more erratic (eg, it stops when the machine is
turned off, or the date gets scrambled), try replacing the battery
(but remember to write down your CMOS settings first!).  The CMOS RAM
takes considerably less power than the clock, so it may keep working
even though the battery is too weak to run the clock (see the question
on replacing the battery for details).
 
   A typical cheap quartz watch is rated at +/- 15 sec per month (3
minutes per year) which is about 5.7 ppm (parts per million).  Dallas
Semiconductor rates their encapsulated clock modules for +/- 1 min per
month, or 22.8 ppm. Clocks with external crystals can be "fine-tuned"
with a trimmer capacitor-- if the motherboard designer included one
(Note: there may be more than one crystal on the motherboard). The
crystal's frequency will change slightly over time as the crystal
"ages".
 
   The original IBM AT used the Motorola MC146818, which is a
real-time clock plus 50 bytes of CMOS RAM. This chip is discussed in
the book "The Undocumented PC", from Addison-Welsey. The Dallas
Semiconductor DS1285 is a drop-in replacement for the MC146818, and
the DS1287 is the same chip encapsulated with its own battery and
clock crystal. Other variants include larger amounts of CMOS RAM. Most
software accesses the clock through the BIOS.
 
   Before the AT, there were various types of aftermarket clock cards,
and some of them may still be available (even though every PC sold in
the last several years "already has a clock").
 
   Given the number of times this comes up on the net, there should be
a market for accurate clock cards. On the other hand, most people
don't seem to care whether their computers have anything close to the
correct time. If your machine doesn't keep time correctly, and you
think it should, you might consider complaining to the manufacturer
about it.



Q) 2.42  How can I automatically set my PC's clock to the correct time?
[From: uwvax!astroatc!nicmad!madnix!zaphod (Ron Bean)]

If you're on the internet, you can use ntp (network time protocol) to
set your clock to another machine that's known to be accurate (see RFC
1129, Internet Time Synchronization).
 
   ACTS, the Automated Computer Time Service, is available by modem at
(303)494-4774 (note this is NOT a toll-free call). There are programs
that will dial this number and set your clock automatically. This
service is run by NIST (the National Institute of Standards and
Technology, formerly the National Bureau of Standards).
 
   In Germany, the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB)
broadcasts a coded time signal on 77.5 kHz from a transmitter near
Frankfurt, and inexpensive receivers are available that can plug into
a serial port (this signal should cover most of Europe). In the US,
NIST runs a similar station (WWVB) on 60 kHz, but the data is encoded
differently and receivers are expensive and hard to find.
 
   Other coded time signals are available from WWV and WWVH on 2.5, 5,
10, 15, and 20 MHz (shortwave), and from the GOES and GPS
satellites. CHU Canada on 3.33, 7.335, and 14.670 MHz broadcasts time
codes using Bell 103 FSK (300 baud modem tones) during seconds 31
through 39 of each minute. If you don't have a shortwave receiver, the
WWV audio time announcement can be heard by dialing (303)499-7111
(again, this is NOT a toll-free call).
 
   NIST publishes a 30-page booklet (NIST Special Publication 432)
that explains all of their time services in detail. They also have a
partial list of companies that make receivers, but it appears to be
somewhat out of date. Both are available from:
 
          NIST/Radio Station WWV
          2000 East County Road 58
          Fort Collins, CO  80524-9499
 
   You may have heard about Heathkit's "Most Accurate Clock", which
decodes the time signal from WWV and has a serial port.  Heath no
longer sells kits, but they still sell the factory-built version of
the clock (it's not cheap, though). Their address is P.O. Box 1288,
Benton Harbor, MI 49023.



Q) 2.43  What is the battery for and how do I replace it?

[From: uwvax!astroatc!nicmad!madnix!zaphod (Ron Bean)]

   The battery maintains power to the CMOS RAM and the real-time clock
when your PC is turned off. You may have a small lithium "coin"
battery soldered to the motherboard, or a larger external one plugged
into a connector. Some motherboards have a jumper to select either
type, and a few have a NiCd battery that recharges automatically, or a
lithium battery encapsulated in the clock chip.
 
   NOTE: Always write down your CMOS settings before you mess with the
battery! In fact, you should write them down now anyway, in case the
battery fails later.
 
   The batteries that are soldered in or encapsulated with the clock
chip are supposed to last 10 years or more, but your mileage may
vary. Some people find that the external type has to be replaced every
couple of years. Self-recharging NiCds that get power from a disk
drive cable are available as aftermarket items.  A few people have
tried to save money by substituting 4 alkaline AA batteries for the
expensive external lithium battery, but they have to be replaced more
often.
 
   If you need to replace a soldered-in battery, have a repair shop
install a socket (you shouldn't attempt this yourself, unless you're
experienced at soldering on expensive multi-layer circuit boards). If
the battery is encapsulated in the chip, there is no way to replace it
without replacing the chip-- again, consult a repair shop if it's not
socketed. These chips can be "turned off" via software to extend
battery life during storage, and are shipped from the factory that
way.

Q) 2.44  Can I use IRQ2 or is it special?

IRQ2 is used to cascade the second interrupt controller on AT
machines.  This has one and only one side effect: from a software
point of view, IRQ2 = IRQ9.  You can freely use IRQ2 on any hardware
device, provided you are not already using IRQ9.  Your associated
software driver can be set to IRQ2 or IRQ9, which ever it happens to
prefer.  Note that many video cards have an IRQ2 enable jumper for
very, very old backward compatibility reasons; you should disable this
before attempting to use the IRQ for something else.  There are no
unexpected side effects.

Q) 2.45  Where do all the IRQ's and DMA Channels go?

S) 3.0 IO controllers/interfaces

Q) 3.1  *How do IDE/MFM/RLL/ESDI/SCSI interfaces work?

Q) 3.2  How can I tell if I have MFM/RLL/ESDI/IDE/SCSI?

[From: ralf@wpi.edu (Ralph Valentino)]

The most reliable way to tell what type of drive you have is to call
the manufacturer with the model number and ask.  There is an extensive
list of phone numbers in the References section of the FAQ. 

That aside, the first thing to check is the number of pins on the
drive's connector(s).  The second thing to check is the CMOS setup,
assuming, of course, that it is in a working system.

SCSI = 1 cable: 50 pins (note 1,2)
  usually set up as "not installed" in the CMOS
IDE  = 1 cable: 40 pins
  no reliable way to tell from the CMOS
RLL  = 2 cables: 34 pins & 20 pins
  always has 26 sectors per track
MFM  = 2 cables: 34 pins & 20 pins
  always has 17 sectors per track (note 3)
ESDI = 2 cables: 34 pins & 20 pins (note 4)
  usually set up as type #1 in the CMOS and auto-configured at boot time

If you've narrowed it down to RLL/MFM or ESDI but it isn't in a
working system, there's no easy way to narrow it down any further just
by looking at the drive.

note 1: The QIC-2 tape drive interface also has 50 pins
note 2: To differentiate single ended and differential SCSI, see the scsi-faq
note 3: Some people attempt to set up MFM drives as RLL with varying success,
        this method will only tell you what it is set up as.
note 4: While ESDI uses the same type of cables as RLL and MFM, the
        signals are very different - do not connect ESDI to RLL or MFM!


Q) 3.3  Do caching controllers really help?
[From: backbone!wayne@tower.tssi.com (Wayne Schlitt)]

The short answer, is that if you are using a multi-tasking
operating system with a good memory manager, caching controllers
should be ignored.  If you are running DOS or Windows, then *maybe*
they will help, but I am not sure that they are a good buy.  

There are lots of people who have said "I put a caching controller in
my computer, and it runs faster!".  This is probably true, but they
never have measured the speed increase compared to putting the same
memory into main memory instead.  More importantly, the caching
controllers cost more money than non caching controllers, so you
should be able to add _more_ main memory instead of buying a caching
controller.

The following is a shortened up version of a much longer article.  If
you want a copy of the longer article, send me email at
"wayne@cse.unl.edu".

*** Why a multi-tasking operating system?

A multi-tasking operating system can allow the application to continue
immediately after it does a write, and the actual disk write can
happen later.  This is known as write behind.  The operating system
can also read several blocks from the file when the application
requests just part of the first block.  This is known as read ahead.
When the application requests the block later on, the block will
already be there and the OS can then schedule some more reads.

A multitasking operating system is required because these operations
can cause interrupts and processing when control has been given back to
the application.  

Basically, operating systems such as DOS, MS-Windows, MacOS and such
do not allow true preemptive multitasking and can not do the read a
heads and the write behinds.  For these systems, the latency of a disk
drive is the most important thing.  The application does not regain
control until the read or write has finished. 

*** The controller can't speed up the disk.

Remember, the bottleneck is at the disk.  Nothing that the controller
can do can make the data come off the platters any faster.  All but the
oldest and slowest controllers can keep up with all but the newest and
fastest disks.  The SCSI bus is designed to be able to keep *several*
disks busy without slowing things down.

Speeding up parts of the system that are not the bottleneck won't help
much.  The goal has to be to reduce the number of real disk accesses.

*** First, isn't the caching controller hardware and isn't hardware
*** always faster than software?

Well, yes there is a piece of physical hardware that is called the
caching controller, but no, the cache is not really "in hardware".
Managing a disk is a fairly complicated task, complicated enough that
you really can't implement the controller in combinatorial logic. 

So, just about all disk controllers and for that matter all disk
drives have a general purpose computer on them.  They run a little
software program that manages the communication between the main cpu
and the disk bus, or the disk bus and the disk.  Often this cpu is put
in with a bunch of other logic as part of a standard cell custom chip,
so you might not see a chip that says "Z80" or such.

So, we are really not comparing "hardware" with "software", we are
comparing "software on the controller" with "software on the main
cpu".

*** Ok, why can the OS win?

Assume that you have a bunch of memory that you can either put into
main memory and have the OS manage the cache, or put on a caching
controller.  Which one will be better?  Let us look at the various
cases. 

For a cache hit you have:

If the OS does the caching, you just have the OS's cache checking
latency.

If the card does the caching, you will have the OS's cache checking
latency, plus the I/O setup time, plus the controller's cache checking
latency, plus you have to move the data from the card to main memory.
If the controller does DMA, it will be taking away from the memory
bandwidth that the main CPU needs.  If the controller doesn't have
DMA, then the main CPU will have to do all the transfers, one word at
a time.

For a cache miss, you have:

If the OS does the caching, you have the OS's cache checking latency
plus the set up time for the disk I/O, plus the time it takes for the
disk to transfer the data (this will be a majority of the time), plus the
cost of doing either the DMA or having the CPU move the data into main
memory. 

The caching controller will have all of the above times, plus it's own
cache checking latency.

As you can see, the caching controller adds a lot of overhead no
matter what.  This overhead can only be offset when you get a cache
hit, but since you have the same amount of memory on the controller
and the main cpu, you should have the same number of cache hits in
either case.  Therefore, the caching controller will always give more
overhead than an OS managed cache.

*** Yeah, but there is this processor on the controller doing the
*** cache checks, so you really have a multi-processor system.
*** Shouldn't this be faster than a single processor?  Doesn't this
*** allow the main cpu to do other things while the controller manages
*** the cache?

Yes, this really is a multi-processor system, but multi-processors are
not always faster than uni-processors.  In particular, multi-processor
systems have communication overhead.  In this case, you are
communicating with the controller using a protocol that is fairly
expensive, with outb instructions and interrupts and such.  The
overhead of communicating with this other processor is greater than
the overhead of just checking the cache on main cpu, even if the main
cpu is very slow.  

The multi-processor aspect just doesn't help out when you are talking
about managing a cache.  There is just too much communication overhead
and too little processing for it to be a win.

*** Ok, but couldn't the caching controller do a better job of
*** managing the cache?

Both the controller and the OS are going to be executing a piece of
software, so in theory there isn't anything that the slower cpu on the
controller can do that the OS can't do, but the OS can do things that
the controller can't do.

Here are some of the things that the OS can do better:

* When you read a block from a file, the OS can read several more
  blocks ahead of time.  Caching controllers often will read an entire
  track in order to simulate this file read a head, but the rest of
  the file isn't always on the same track, only the OS knows where the
  blocks are really going to be at.  This can lead to wasted time and
  cache memory reading data that will never be used.

* In order to improve file system reliability, some writes _must_
  complete immediately, and _must_ complete in the order that they are
  given.  Otherwise, the file system structures may not be left in a
  coherent state if the system crashes.

  Other writes can be completed as time is available, and can be done
  in any order.  The operating system knows the difference between
  these cases and can do the writes appropriately.

  Caching controllers, on the other hand, don't know if the write that
  it was just given _must_ be written right away, or if it can wait a
  little bit.  If it waits when it shouldn't, you are risking your
  file system and data.  

* Sometimes, you want a large disk cache if you are accessing lots of
  data off the disk.  At other times, you want a small disk cache and
  more memory left to programs.  The operating system can balance
  these needs dynamically and adjust the amount of disk cache
  automatically.

  If you put the memory on a caching controller, then that memory can
  _only_ be used for disk caches, and you can _never_ use more.
  Chances are, you will either have too much or too little memory
  dedicated to the cache at any give time. 

* When a process closes a file, the operating system knows that the
  blocks associated with that file are not as likely to to be used
  again as those blocks associated with files that are still open.
  Only the operating system is going to know when files are closed,
  the controller won't.  Similar things happen with processes.

* In the area of Virtual Memory, the OS does an extremely better job
  of managing things.  When a program accesses a piece of memory, the
  CPU will do a hardware level check to see if the page is in memory.
  If the page is in memory, then there will basically be no delay.  It
  is only when the page isn't in memory that the OS gets involved.

  Even if all of those extra pages are sitting in the
  caching controller's memory, they still have to be moved to main
  memory with all the overhead that that involves.

  This is why dynamic caches vs program memory is so important.

*** What is the "Memory Hierarchy" and how does this relate to
*** caching controllers?

The basic idea of a memory hierarchy is to layer various types of
memory, so that the fastest memory is closest to the cpu.  Faster
memory is more expensive, so you can't use only the fastest type and
still be cheap.  If a piece of data isn't in the highest (fastest)
level of the hierarchy, then you have to check the next level down.

In order for a memory hierarchy to work well, you need to make sure
that the each level of the hierarchy has much more storage then the
level above it, otherwise you wont have a high hit rate.

The hierarchy on a 486 goes something like this:

8 regs << 8k on chip cache << 256k off chip cache << main memory << disk

If you are going to put something between main memory and disk, it
needs to be much larger than main memory in order for it to be
effective. 

*** What about all these neat things that a caching controller can do
*** such as elevator seeking, overlapping seeks with reads and writes,
*** scatter/gather, etc...

These are nice features, but they are all done by either the OS or a
good SCSI controller anyway.  None of these things are at all related
to supporting the cache, so you shouldn't buy a caching controller for
just these features.

*** Ok, you have talked about things like Unix, OS/2 and Windows NT,
*** but what about DOS and MS-Windows?

Well, here things get a lot grayer.  First, older versions of DOS have
notoriously bad disk cache programs.  Since neither DOS nor MS-Windows
are preemptive multi-tasking systems, it is much harder to do read a
head.  Also, since DOS/MS-Windows users are used to being able to
power off their computers at any time, doing write behind is much more
dangerous.  DOS and MS-Windows also can crash much easier than these
other OS's, so people might reboot for many reasons.  

Caching controllers usually leave the hard disk light on when they
have data that hasn't been written out, and people don't usually power
their computer off until that light goes out.  This lets the
controllers do write behind fairly safely.  (But you can still loose
power, so this isn't risk free.)  They also do crude read a heads by
prereading entire tracks.

DOS also runs in real mode and real mode can only access 640K of
memory.  This mean that a disk cache can be real helpful.
Unfortunately, to do a software based disk cache, the cpu has to be
switched into protected mode in order to access memory beyond the 640K
boundary and then you have to switch back into real mode.  Intel,
however forgot to make it easy to switch back to real mode.   All in
all, this switching back and forth ends up being real expensive.  This
_might_ be more expensive than just using a caching controller, I
don't know.

So, it is possible that if you configure DOS to not use a cache, and
get a caching controller, then you might be a head.  I really don't
know much about this area.  I have not done any real timings of this.

*** So, when would you ever want to buy a caching controller?

The answer is not too often, but there are a few cases that I can
think of:

* You have filled up all your SIMM slots on your motherboard and in
  order to add more memory you would have to throw some out.  This is
  a real shaky reason.  You can always sell your old memory, or move
  it to another computer.  The jump from 4 1MB SIMMs to 4 4MB SIMMs is
  large, but you will be much better off in the long run with more
  main memory.

* You have maxed out your memory and you need it all for programs and
  data.  If you can't put any more memory on the mother board, then
  you don't have many choices.

* If you have a bunch of slow (100ns-120ns) memory left over from say
  a 286 or something and you can't use it on your motherboard because
  it is too slow, then maybe adding it to a caching controller
  will help.  Be careful however, if your hit rates on the caching
  controller are too low, then you may be just adding overhead without
  getting any benefits.

* If you are stuck with a bad OS because that's what your applications
  run on, then you might be better off with a caching controller.

*** What about those disk drives that come with caches, are they bad too?

Don't confuse caching disk controllers with cache on disk drives.  The
latter is actually useful.  The little cpu on the disk drive has to
read every byte that comes off the disk in order to see when the
sector that you are interested in has come under the heads and to do
any error detection and correction.  The disk also has to have buffers
in case the bus is busy, and to sync up the speeds of the bus and the
heads.

Since all this data is going though the cpu on disk drive and you have
to have a buffer anyway, just making the buffer larger and saving the
entire track is an easy win.  Saving a couple of the most frequent
tracks is also a win.

Most of these caches on the disk drives are fairly small (64k-256k),
and a single memory chip will give you about that amount of memory
anyway, so you aren't wasting many resources.  This also allows the OS
to always assume that interleaving is not necessary to get full disk
throughput, even if it does a fair amount of processing between disk
requests. 


Q) 3.4  Do IDE controllers use DMA?

No, they do not.  This is a rumor that keeps popping up.  This may
change on the next revision of the standard.

Q) 3.5  Why won't my two IDE drives work together?

[From: jruchak@mtmis1.mis.semi.harris.com (John Anthony Ruchak)]

Assuming that the drives are attached to the same controller and they
work properly when attached one-at-a-time, you probably don't have
them configured properly for Master/Slave operation.

When operating 2 IDE drives, one must be designated as "Master" and
the other as "Slave."  There are jumpers on every IDE drive to
configure this.  Check your hard drive manuals for the jumper settings
for your drives.  In general, it doesn't matter which is which - just
pick one as master, and make the other slave.

In your CMOS configuration, Drive 1 should have the parameters (heads,
cylinders, etc.) that match the drive you set as "Master" and Drive
2's parameters should match those of the "slave" drive.  In operation,
the Master will appear as drive C: and the slave as drive D:.

Because not all hard drive manufacturers follow the IDE specifications
closely enough, drives from 2 different manufacturers may not work well
together.  In this case, changing master -> slave and slave -> master
(along with the appropriate CMOS changes) may help.  If it doesn't,
then trying two drives from the SAME manufacturer is the only avenue
you have left.

Q) 3.6  Which is better, VLB or ISA IDE?
[From: pieterh@sci.kun.nl]

If a simple answer is what you want, then yes, in general VLB IDE
controllers are better than ISA ones.  If you are purchasing or
putting together a computer, the relatively small price difference
makes the choice for a VLB controller a sensible one.

However, if you already have an ISA controller and are wondering
whether it's worth upgrading to VLB, it's not that easy.  VLB may be
faster in principle, the question is if you're going to notice it.


 *** The Bottlenecks

Let's take a look at what the limiting factors are in the path the
data travels from your drive platter to the CPU.

1. Raw data transfer from the drive platter.  To find out what this
   rate is, you need the spec sheet for your drive.  Remember that
   it is dependent on the cylinder, so a single drive can give
   different results depending on where on the drive you're testing.
   
   Anyway, this transfer rate is 1 to 2 MB/s on most IDE drives,
   depending on data density and rotational speed.

2. The data has to be digested by the drive's onboard controller,
   which not only mediates between the drive hardware and the IDE
   bus, but also manages the buffer cache.  Let's hope it's both
   fast and intelligent (not always the case *sigh*).
   
3. Data transfer over the IDE/ATA bus (2-3MB/s with standard
   timing).  The actual speed depends on the timing used; some
   drives and controllers support faster timing.  Enhanced IDE
   (IDE-2) can transfer up to 11 MB/s.
 
4. Transfer from the interface to the CPU (ISA: max 5 Mb/s, VLB:
   10-80 MB/s depending on CPU clock, wait states, interface...)
 
A generic IDE interface is usually not able to get the most out
of the ISA and IDE bandwidths (3 and 4); a typical upper limit is
about 2 MB/s if you use block transfers (see below), 2.5 MB/s if
you're willing to push the ISA bus clock a little (more about
that later on).

Still, it's clear that on all but the fastest drives the raw data
transfer rate to/from the drive platter (1) will determine the
maximum performance you're going to get.  If you're getting
transfer rates near this limit, you can't significantly improve
your throughput whatever you do.


 *** Tuning Your Harddisk

Suppose your harddisk throughput is lower than you think is
possible with your drive.  How can you tune your system to improve
hard disk performance?  I'll go through points 1-4 again and
indicate what you can do to widen up the bottlenecks a little.

1. Drive platter to head transfer.
    - Sorry, there's nothing you can do short of getting a new
      drive.
      
2. The drive controller.
    - Many modern drives understand "block transfer", also known as
      multi-sector I/O or read/write multiple.	Although the newest
      BIOSes have this feature built in, most of us will have to
      use a driver.  More about that at the end of this section.
      
      What is block transfer?  Normally, for each sector the
      computer wants to read from or write to the drive, it has to
      issue a separate command.  When you're transfering 2 MB/s,
      that means you're sending the drive 4,000 commands each
      second.  Each command has to be issued by the CPU, transferred
      over the ISA and IDE buses, interpreted and acted upon by the
      drive's onboard controller.  Every such command takes a little
      time.
   
      By using block transfer mode, it is possible to read or write
      more than one sector (usually 4 to 32) using a single command.
      This greatly cuts down command overhead, as you can imagine,
      and may very well have a dramatic effect on a badly performing
      system.  In most cases, it will improve performance by 5-20%.
      
      Unfortunately some older drives have inferior support of this
      feature and actually slow down...  or in exceptional cases
      even hose your data.

3. The IDE bus.
    - With most drives you can use faster IDE bus timing, but your
      interface has to support this.  Modern IDE interface chips
      often have completely programmable timing; these can be
      exceptionally fast if the software supports this feature and,
      of course, if the drive can keep up.  Some controllers use
      jumpers to configure timing.

      The last word in IDE bus bandwidth is of course the Enhanced
      IDE bus, which allows exceedingly fast transfers if both
      drives and interface support it.

      If you cannot use improved timing with a new VLB interface,
      the IDE bus will prove to be as much as a bottleneck as the
      ISA bus was.

    - Not all interfaces are created equal, some are better
      engineered.  With the current VLB hype, there's bound to be
      a friend who has an old (ISA) interface gathering dust; try
      that one.

4. The ISA bus.
    - The official speed of the ISA bus is about 8 MHz, but most
      cards, especially modern ones, will work fine on 11 MHz or
      more (some will even take as much as 20 MHz).  If you don't
      mind experimenting, it may be worthwhile to see if your
      ISA cards run reliably at a higher bus clock.  This is
      especially interesting if your drive nears the 2MB/s mark.

      The BIOS setup has to support this, of course.

      *WARNING* Pushing the ISA bus clock beyond spec often works
      well, but there is always the risk that it DESTROYS YOUR
      DATA.  Make a backup before attempting this and thoroughly
      verify correct operation before entrusting critical jobs to
      a "pushed" system.

    - Finally, if you need more than the 2.5-3 MB/s or so you can
      squeeze out of a good ISA controller, VLB is the way to go.
      Be aware that the controllers on the market are of variable
      quality; VLB alone isn't going to be enough if you need the
      highest performance.  It has occurred that a VLB interface
      proved to be, all things equal, slower than the ISA one it
      replaced!

      Take special note of the drivers: they must be stable and
      support whatever software you intend to use (DOS, Windows
      32-bit VxD, OS/2).  Without a driver loaded, the VLB
      interface will perform no better than an ISA controller.

A final word about block transfer drivers.  VLB controllers are
usually shipped with a TSR that, among other things, enables block
transfers (usually designated "Turbo" mode)---this is often where
most of the performance gain actually comes from.  But block mode
is equally possible using ISA based interfaces.  Popular block
transfer drivers are Drive Rocket and DiskQwik.  You can get a
crippled version of the latter from Simtel:

	pub/msdos/diskutil/dqwik110.zip

If you're using Linux, you can use Mark Lord's IDE performance
patches to enable block mode.  In true multitasking operating
systems, block transfers have the additional advantage of greatly
reducing CPU load.



Q) 3.7  How do I install a second controller?
[From: strople@ug.cs.dal.ca (PAUL LESLIE STROPLE)]

The following should solve about 95% (9.5?) of second controller
problems, if only to tell you it can't be done!
 
Generic Second Controller Installation:

1) Normally the MFM/IDE/RLL controller is set up as the primary, and
the ESDI/SCSI as the secondary; One reason for this is because the
ESDI/SCSI controller cards are usually more flexible in their set up
and secondly this method seems to work (probably due to reason one).
 
2) Your primary controller is set up using all the normal defaults:
   - Floppy  at primary address(3F0-3F7).
   - Hard disk enabled, at primary addresses (1F0-1F7),
BIOS address C800 and interrupt 14.
 
3) Your secondary controller is set up as:
   - Floppy drives disabled
   - Hard disk controller enabled, secondary address(170- 177) and
     interrupt 15.
   - NOTE: onboard bios set to D400, or D800 can be used, if there is a
     conflict.
 
4) Computer BIOS Setup:
   - Any drive(s) on the primary controller (MFM/IDE), should be
     entered in the BIOS setup as usual.
   - You DO NOT enter the drive types for the hard disks on the
secondary controller, even if there are only two drives in the entire
system i.e., if one drive on each controller you only enter the drive
type of the hard disk on the primary controller -- the 2nd drive type
is left as not installed (0).
 
Operating System:
 
If you do the above steps you now have the hardware setup correctly;
your only other problem may be with the operating system.
 
Different OSs handle secondary controllers differently; as well,
different controllers handles same OSs differently (scared yet?).
 
For example: with DOS you may require a device driver (available from
the manufacture or through third party companies, such as Ontrack
Computer Systems -- more on Ontrack later). Some flavors of UNIX
handle a mixture of controllers better than others (e.g., IA 5.4 had
probs mixing ESDI and SCSI controllers under certain conditions).
 
Procedure:
 
You should verify that your secondary controller, and associated hard
drives, are working properly (you can try this by installing it as the
primary system -- removing existing system first!).  Follow above
steps 1 to 4, pray, and turn on system! If it still won't work you may
need additional drivers. First check with the supplier or manufacture
(I know, for example, a DTC ESDI controller comes with the DOS drivers
included, and it works perfectly).
 
I am not sure of operating systems supported by Ontrack Data Systems.
I know that their DOS driver can assist secondary controllers, even
allowing two IDEs to co-exist. Likewise, the drivers can also install
virtually any drive, regardless of what is supported by the BIOS.
 
BIG NOTE: The features required in a secondary controller a normally
not found on a $30.00 IDE controller. The best thing to do it, if
possible, is to get a guarantee from the supplier/manufacture that if
it doesn't work (and they can't make it) then they will take it back.
 
Ontrack supplies a complete range of hard disk products and services
-- from driver software, data recovery services, to media and data
conversions (including tape backups).  The product I know them from is
DiskManager.
 
Disk Manager is a utility for hard disk management. It will allow you
to setup and install virtually any hard disk, regardless of disk's
layout and BIOS options available. Disk Manager (version greater than
5.2.X, or there abouts) includes a driver for co-resident controllers.
For driver to work the co-res board must be able to hit the above
addresses and must be WD1003 AT command set compatible (this includes
most IDE and ESDI boards).
 
DM contains a number of features, including full diagnostics.  You may
not need to know the disk's geometry, as there are numerous layouts
stored internally. All you need to do is select the correct model and
DM does the rest.

Q) 3.8  Which is better, SCSI or IDE?
[From: ralf@wpi.wpi.edu (Ralph Valentino)]

IDE vs SCSI

Non-issues:
1) SCSI and IDE devices cost approximately the same for the same
   features (size, speed, access time).  Shop around for good prices.

Advantages of IDE:
1) faster response time (low request overhead)
2) hard drive interface is compatible with RLL/MFM/ESDI: any driver
for one (including the main system BIOS) will run the other.
3) IDE controllers are considerably cheaper ($150 and up) than SCSI
   host adapters. 
4) Will always be the boot device when mixed with SCSI.

Advantages of SCSI:
1) Supports up to 7 devices per host adapter.  This saves slots,
IRQ's, DMA channels and, as you add deviceds, money.
2) Supports different types of devices simultaneously the same host
adapter (hard drives, tape drives, CDROMs, scanners, etc).
3) SCSI devices will work in other systems as well (Mac, Sparc, and
countless other workstations and mainframes).  If you change platforms
in the future, you will still be able to use your SCSI devices.
4) Automatically configures device type, geometry (size), speed and
even manufacturer/model number(SCSI-2).  No need to look up CMOS
settings.
5) Busmastering DMA (available in all but a few cheap SCSI host
adapters) decreases amount of CPU time required to do I/O, leaving
more time to work on other tasks (in multitasking OS's only).
6) Software portability - drivers are written for the host adapter,
not the specific device.  That is, if you have a CDROM driver for your
host adapter, you can purchase any brand or speed SCSI CDROM drive and
it will work in your system.
7) Will coexist with any other type of controller (IDE/RLL/MFM/ESDI)
or host adapter (other SCSI cards) without any special tricks.  SCSI
host adapters do not take up one of the two available hard drive
controller port addresses.
8) greater bandwidth utilization (higher throughput) with multiple
devices.  Supports pending requests, which allows the system to
overlap requests to multiple devices so that one device can be seeking
while the second is returning data.
9) Ability to "share" devices between machines by connecting them to
the same SCSI bus.  (note: this is considerably more difficult to do
than it sounds).
10) Bridges are available to hook RLL and ESDI drives to your SCSI host
adapter.  (note: these tend to be prohibitively expensive, though).

Warnings:
1) With otherwise equal drives, IDE will perform better in DOS due to
low command overhead.  SCSI, however, will perform better in
multitasking OS's (OS/2, Unix, NT, etc).  If you see speed comparisons
(benchmarks), make sure you know what OS they were run under.
2) Most benchmarks only test one aspect of your system at a time, not
the effect various aspects have on each other.  For instance, an IDE
drive may get faster throughput but hurt CPU performance during the
transfer, so your system may actually run slower.  Similar confusions
arise when comparing VLB and EISA host adapters.
3) When comparing two systems, keep in mind that CPU, memory, cache,
and bus speed/type will all effect disk performance.  If someone gets
great I/O performance with a particular controller/drive combination
on his Pentium, you should not expect your 386SX-25 to get such I/O
performance even with the exact same controller/drive combination.
4) Similarly sized or even priced drives may not perform equally, even
if they're made by the same manufacturer.  If you're going to compare
two drives, make sure they have the exact same model number.  (IDE
drives usually have an 'A' and SCSI drives usually have an 'S'
appended to their model number).


Q) 3.9  Can MFM/RLL/ESDI/IDE and SCSI coexist?

The PC is limited to two drive controllers total.  SCSI, however, is a
"host adapter" and not a drive controller.  To the rest of your
system, it appears more like an ethernet card than a drive controller.
For this reason, SCSI will always be able to coexist with any type
dive controller.  The main drawback here is that on most systems, you
must boot off a disk on the primary drive controller, if you have one.
That means if you have SCSI and IDE in your system, for example, you
can not directly boot from the SCSI drive.  There are various ways to
get around this limitation, including the use of a boot manager.

Q) 3.10  What's the difference between SCSI and SCSI-2? Are they compatible?

The main difference between SCSI and SCSI-2 are some new minor
features that the average person will never notice.  Both run at a
maximum 5M/s.  (note: Fast and Wide SCSI-2 will potentially run at
faster rates).  All versions of SCSI will work together.  On power up,
the SCSI host adapter and each device (separately) determine the best
command set the speed that each is capable of.  For more information
on this, refer to the comp.periphs.scsi FAQ.

Q) 3.11  +How am I suppose to terminate the SCSI bus?

Some basic rules on termination:

1. The SCSI bus needs exactly two terminators, never more, never less. 
2. Devices on the SCSI bus should form a single chain that can be
   traced from the device at one end to the device at the other.  No
   'T's are allowed; stub length should be kept as short as possible.
3. The device at each end of the (physical) SCSI bus must be
   terminated, all other devices must be unterminated.
4. All unused connectors must be placed _between_ the two terminated devices.
5. The host adapter (controller) is a SCSI device.
6. Host adapters may have both an internal and external connector; these
   are tied together internally and should be thought of as an "in"
   and "out" (though direction has no real meaning).  If you have only
   internal or external devices, the host adapter is terminated
   otherwise it is not.
7. SCSI ID's are logical assignments and have nothing to do with where
   they go on the SCSI bus or if they should be terminated.
8. Just because your incorrectly terminated system happens to work
   now, don't count on it continuing to do so.  Fix the termination.

Examples:

      internal      external           internal            external
    T------|-----|------T          T------|-------|-----|------|------T
 drive   drive   HA    cdrom      tape  unused unused   HA   drive  drive

        internal             external             external
     T------|-----T      T------|------T          T------T
   drive  drive   HA     HA    tape   cdrom       HA    cdrom

"T" = terminator   "|" = connector (no terminator)   "HA" = Host Adapter

Q) 3.12  Can I share SCSI devices between computers?

There are two ways to share SCSI devices.  The first is removing the
device from one SCSI host adapter and placing it on a second.  This
will always work if the power is off and will usually work with the
power on, but for it to be guaranteed to work with the power on, your
host adapter must be able to support "hot swaps" - the ability to
recover from any errors the removal/addition might cause on the SCSI
bus.  This ability is most common in RAID systems.

The second way to share SCSI devices is by connecting two SCSI busses
together.  This is theoretically possible, but difficult in practice,
especially when disk drives are on the same SCSI chain.  There are a
number of resource reservation issues which must be resolved in the
OS, including disk caching.  Don't expect it to 'just work'.

Q) 3.13  What is Thermal Recalibration?

When the temperature of the hard drive changes, the media expands
slightly.  In modern drives, the data is so densely packed that this
expansion can actually become significant, and if it is not taken into
account, data written when the drive is cold may not be able to be
read when the drive is warm.  To compensate for this, many drives now
perform "Thermal Recalibration" every degree C (or so) as the drive
warms up and then some longer periodic interval once the drive has
reached normal operating temperature.  When thermal recalibration
takes place, the heads are moved and the drive may sound like you are
accessing it.  This is perfectly normal.

If you're attempting to access the drive when thermal recalibration
occurs, you may experience a slight delay.  The only time this becomes
important is when you're doing real-time operations like recording /
playing sound or video.  Proper software buffering of the data should
be able to hide this from the application, but software seldom does
the proper thing on its own.  Because of this, a few companies have
come out with special drive models for audio/video use which employ
special buffering techniques right on the drive.  These drives, of
course, cost significantly more than their counterparts.  Some other
drives offer a way to trigger thermal recalibration prematurely (thus
resetting the timer), so if your real-time operation is shorter than
the recalibration interval, you can use this to assure your operation
goes uninterrupted.  Disabling or delaying recalibration is dangerous
and should be completely avoided.  For more information on the thermal
recalibration characteristics of a drive, contact the drive
manufacturer directly.

Q) 3.14  Can I mount my hard drive sideways/upside down?

Old hard drives always had specific requirements for mounting while
most modern hard drives can be mounted in any orientation.  Some
modern hard drives still have mounting restrictions; the only way to
be sure is to read the documentation that comes with the drive or
contact the manufacturer directly and ask.  Restrictions may be model
specific so be sure you know the exact model number of your drive.  A
common misconception is that it is always safe to mount the circuit
board side up, this is not the case.  When in doubt, look it up.

Failure to follow the mounting instructions can result in a shortened
lifetime.


Q) 3.15  How do I swap A: and B:
[From: rgeens@wins.uia.ac.be (Ronald Geens)]

To swap A: and B: drives :
1) open up your machine to see if look at the cable that interconnects
the 2 drives.
2) if the cable is twisted, there is no problem, just switch the
connectors from 1 drive to the other.And change the bios-setup.
3) if the cable isn't twisted (which is very,very rare), it's a little
harder: leave the cables as they are, but change the jumpers on the
drive. (this sounds a lot tougher, but it can usually be done without
to much hassle.  When the cable connecting the 2 drives is just a flat
one (like the harddisk cable) then you must play with the jumpers on
the drives: Most of the time, there is a jumper with 4 pins, with the
following layout:
                               _
                              |1|
			     |2*3|
                              ---

Where the * is the 4th unnumbered pin. Normally the A: drive will have a 
jumper on pin 2 & 4 and the B: drive on 1 & 4. Just change these jumpers 
around, (i.e. new A: 2&4, new B: 1&4) and change the BIOS configuration.
4) Don't panic if it doesn't work, just make sure all cables are
conected properly and if that doesn't work just restore everything to
its old state.
PS. By twisted cable, I mean that between the A: and B: drive, a few
wires of the flat cable are turned around.

[From: sward+@CMU.EDU (David Reeve Sward)]

I have found two ways to do this: I originally switched their
positions on the cable attached to the controller, and changed the
BIOS to reflect this.  I recently got a gsi model 21 controller for my
IDE drive, and this controller allows you to specify which drive is A:
and B: in software (it lights the LEDs in turn and asks which is A:
and which is B:).  This did not require a cable change (but I still
changed by BIOS).


Q) 3.16  My floppy drive doesn't work and the light remains on, why?

If you've played around with the floppy cables at all, chances are you
put one of them on backwards.  In general, floppy cables aren't keyed
to prevent this.  Carefully find pin 1 on all floppy drives and the
floppy controller and make sure they all line up with pin 1 on the
cable.  If you have trouble with this, "How do I find pin 1..."
elsewhere in this FAQ may be of some help.

Q) 3.17  What is a 16550 and do I need one?

The 16550 is a UART with two 16 byte FIFOs.  A UART is the part of a
serial port that takes byte-wide (characters) data and converts it to
bit-wide (serial) data, and visa versa.  The FIFO is a buffer which
can hold characters until the CPU is ready to remove it or until the
serial line is ready to transmit it.  The 'normal' UART in the PC (the
8250 or 16450) only has 1-byte FIFOs.  The additional 15 bytes can be
useful when the CPU is busy doing other things - if the CPU isn't able
to remove data fast enough, it will be lost.  The OS or program has to
explicitly support 16550 to make full use of its advantages.

A very important thing to note is that under DOS, the CPU doesn't have
anything else to do, so the 16550 is wasted.  Only under multitasking
operating systems does it really become useful.  The 16550 will *not*
make your file transfers any faster, it will only prevent data from
being lost and relieve your CPU of some overhead.  If you notice
system performance dropping like a rock when file transfers are
occurring, a 16550 may be helpful.  If you see re-transmissions (bad
packets) or "FIFO overrun's" during file transfers under a
multitasking OS, try the same thing under DOS - if the errors go away,
then chances are a 16550 will be useful.  If they remain, then your
problem is likely to be elsewhere.

Q) 3.18  *Are there any >4 serial port cards?

Q) 3.19  Should I buy an internal or external modem?
[From: arnoud@ijssel.hacktic.nl (Arnoud Martens)]

While low speed modems are often only produced as an internal PC card,
most modem manufacturers provide two versions of their higher speed
modems:

1: internal ISA bus card, specially designed to work with the
standard PC bus. You just plug it in and configure it to use on
port.

2: external modem that has to be connected to the serial ports of
your PC (com 1-4), using a serial RS232 cable.

In most cases the functionality of these two is equal. There are
however some differences in using, maintaining and buying these
modems. It is very difficult to give an definite answer as to which one
is better, it completely depends on your own situation. Some of the
points that are in favor of an external modem are:

  * It has lights showing the status of the connection, this can be
    useful in those (rare) cases that you have problems with the
    connection.

  * It can be used on a wide range of systems. External modems
    are connected using a RS232 cable, a standard that most computer
    systems support. So you can as easily use your external modem
    on a Mac, Amiga or Unix box as on your PC. 

  * It doesn't consume power inside the PC (it uses a normal net
    adapter), and doesn't produce any heat inside your PC.

On the other hand the internal modem has also a couple of advantages
compared to an external modem:
   
  * It is always cheaper, Somewhere in the order of 10% less compared
    to the same external modem.

  * It doesn't need special serial hardware since it has already
    been integrated on the board, which will make it even more
    cheaper. 
   
So basically if portability of your modem is an issue, you are better
of with an external modem. But if you only intend to use the modem
with your PC and don't have any power problems, an internal modem is
the best choice.


Q) 3.20  What do all of the modem terms mean?
[From: arnoud@ijssel.hacktic.nl (Arnoud Martens)]

A modem (MOdulator-DEModulator) is a device capable of converting digital
data from your computer into an analog signal that is suitable for
transmission over low band width telephone lines. A modem thus makes it
possible to connect two computers over a telephone line and exchange data
between them.

Basically a modem picks up the phone, and dails a number. A modem on
the other side will pick up the phone and the two modems will
negotiate which protocol to use. When they agree the actual
transmission of data can begin.

The major feature of a modem is the speed that it can achieve
connecting to other modems. This speed is often expressed in baud or
bits per second. The first is a feature of the line and specifies how
much of the bandwidth of the phone channel is used and is fixed to
2400 baud. A baud is defined as the number of lines changes per
second. Bits per second is the actual amount of data transmitted in
one second. Most modems are capable of sending more than one bit per
line transition by using very intelligent signal modulation
techniques. So the bps can be eight times higher compared to trhe baud
rate.

The modulation techniques that a modem uses are standarized by the
ITU-T ( former CCITT), so that modems of different brands can connect
to each other as they use the same modulation schemes. These standards
are often incorporated in a protocol definition that is referred to by
the letter V followed by a number. The most common protocols are:

    V21: (300 baud)
    V22bis: (2400 baud)
    V32: (9600 baud)  
    V32bis: (14400 baud)

A modem is often advertised only by its fastest protocol, most of these
modems "speak" slower protocols as well.

There are also standards on using data compression by the modem, such as MNP5
and V42bis, and error control protocols (V42 and MNP4). These standards can
reduce the transmitted data by a factor four, by using advanced compression
techniques. 

To give you an idea a how fast fast is in modem technology: V32bis transmits
somewhat like 1600 characters per second (that is ~33% of 1 page of
text). Transferring a file of 1Mb takes about 12 minutes. Using V42bis can
speed up transmission to 4000 characters per second for uncompressed data.

Apart from these standardized protocols there are also faster protocols which
are supported by some modem manufacturers. But remember anything faster than
14k4 is *not yet* standarized, and often different manufacturers use their
own modulation scheme that allows only their own modems communicate at that
speed. The most common high speed protocols are:

    V32 terbo (19200 baud)
    V34 (28800 baud) or Vfast. 

The standard for V34 is being worked on, it will be released somewhere in
1994. Some modem manufacturers already sell modems with the (prelimenary) V34
standard. If you are serious about buying a fast modem, upgradability to this
standard should be provided by the manufacturer.

When you use your modem it is important to differentiate between command
status and connect status of your modem. When you are connected to an another
modem everything you send to the modem, will be transmitted to the other
modem. In command mode everything you type will be recieved and interpreted
by the modem. Command mode allows you to change the default settings for
youyr modem.

In command mode it is likely that your modem will respond to the Hayes AT
command set. "AT commands" all have prefix AT, and can be used to change the
(default) settings of your modem. To check if your modem works, fire up a
terminal program (such as kermit), connect to your modem (in kermit c
[ENTER]) and issue AT [ENTER], if your modem works it should respond with
OK. For a list of all "AT commands" see the manual of your modem, as most AT
commands are modem specific.

If you buy a fax-modem, you should pay attention to a couple of things. First
the modem must support Class 2 fax commands, furthermore automatic fax mode
selection is a big pro. That means if you receive a call the modem is capable
of detecting a fax message or a modem connection and act properly (start up a
fax receiving program or spawn something like a login process on the
connection).

Finally there is no best modem to get, brands and qualities change very fast,
as do the prices. If you are interested in buying one, subscribe to the
newsgroup comp.dcom.modems, most postings in this group are very brand
oriented and you will recognize fast enough which users are satisfied over
their modems and which are not.


Q) 3.21  What kinds of sound cards are avalable?

This is covered in the comp.sys.ibm.pc.soundcard FAQ, archive name:
PCsoundcard/soundcard-faq.  Please refer to this document for more
information.

Q) 3.22  Where can I find EISA/VLB sound and IO cards?

Chances are that you won't be able to find them anywhere, and if you
do, they won't be worth the money.  Sound and IO cards have very low
bandwidth requirements, over 10 times lower than the ISA bandwidth and
over 60 times lower than the EISA bandwidth.  For this reason, there
is no advantage in placing them on the more expensive EISA/VLB cards
when the less expensive ISA will more than suffice, especially
considering than all ISA cards will work in an EISA/VLB slot.

Q) 3.23  How does the keyboard interface work?

[From: jhallen@world.std.com (Joseph H Allen)]

The IBM keyboard is connected to the computer through a serial interface
similar to a COM port.  When you press a key, the keyboard sends a
"scan-code" for that key to the computer.  When you release the key, the
keyboard sends a release code to the computer.  If you hold down one key and
press and release another key, the computer will receive the scan-code for
the held key and a scan and release code for the other key.  Since the
release code for the held key was not received, the computer knows that the
held key was down while the other key was pressed.  In this way, the
computer can handle the Shift, Alt and Ctrl keys (and any key could work
like a shift key, since all keys work alike).  The ROM BIOS in the computer
buffers the data from the keyboard, translates the scan-codes to ASCII and
handles the operation of the shift and lock keys.  The keyboard itself also
has a small buffer and there is hardware flow-control for preventing
overruns.  All of this seems simple and quite elegant, but by the time we
get to the AT keyboard the details of the implementation are so complicated
as to ruin an otherwise ideal keyboard.

The XT keyboard's interface almost captures the above elegance (indeed it is
the only elegant thing about the XT, IMHO).  The interface uses a 5-pin DIN
connector with these signal assignments:

     1     CLK/CTS (open-collector)
     2     RxD
     3     RESET
     4     GND
     5     +5V

When the keyboard has a byte to send to the computer, it shifts 9 bits out
to the data line (RxD) with nine clock pulses on the CLK line.  The data
format is 1 start bit, followed by 8 data bits.  The baud rate is roughly
2000 bits per second and is not precisely defined.  Once a byte is
completely transmitted, the computer holds the Clear-To-Send (CTS) line low
to prevent the keyboard from sending any more bytes until the keyboard
interrupt handler reads the current one.  Usually a simple 9-bit clearable
TTL shift register is used to receive keyboard data.  The 9th bit of the
shift register is used to drive an open-collector buffer connected to the
CTS line.  When the start-bit gets all of the way through the shift
register, it holds the CTS line low itself.  Once the CPU reads the
assembled byte, it has only to clear the shift register to release the CTS
line and allow another byte to be received.  Three TTL chips or a single PAL
can implement an entire XT keyboard interface.

The data bytes which the XT sends are also simple.  Codes 0-127 are the
scan-codes.  Codes 128-255 are the release codes- they're the same as the
scan codes, but with the high bit set.  The XT keyboard has only 84 keys, so
not all of the scan-codes are used.

The only problems with the XT keyboard are the lock-status lights
(Caps-lock, Scroll-lock and Num-lock) and the key repeat mechanism.  The
lock-status lights can get out of sync with the computer's idea of which
lock keys are activated, but this only happens if someone resets the
keyboard by unplugging it temporarily.  When you hold a key down long
enough, the keyboard starts repeating the scan-code for that key.  The
release code is still only transmitted once, when the key is released.  The
problem here is that the delay to the start of the repeats and the repeat
rate were made too slow.  Of course, the keyboard really doesn't have to
handle repeat at all, since the computer knows when keys are pressed and
released and has a timer itself.  Old XT keyboard TSRs allowed you to adjust
the repeat delay and rate by duplicating the key repeat mechanism in the
computer.

Once IBM found that it had a nearly perfect keyboard it, of course, decided
that it had to be almost completely redesigned for the AT.  The keyboard
didn't have to be redesigned- there were enough extra scan-codes for the
AT's 101 key keyboard and the repeat mechanism could simply have been moved
to the BIOS.  But no, they had to redesign everything.  Sigh.

The AT uses a 5-pin DIN and the PS/2 uses a smaller connector with the same
signals:

     1     CLK/CTS (open-collector)
     2     RxD/TxD/RTS (open-collector)
     3     Not connected or Reset
     4     GND
     5     +5V

Now the interface is bi-directional.  When the computer wants to send a byte
to the keyboard, it asserts RTS and releases CTS.  If you're lucky, the
keyboard isn't deciding to transmit at the same time and it responds by
giving 10 clock pulses (at about 10000 baud) on the CLK line.  The computer
shifts a frame out on TxD on rising clock edges.  The frame format is now 1
start bit, 8 data bits and 1 odd parity bit.  The keyboard takes RTS being
held low as the first start bit, and the first data bit should be sent on
TxD after the first clock edge is received.  Yes, now you need a full UART
for the keyboard interface since you have to both transmit and receive and
generate and check parity (but it's still not RS-232- that would have been
too logical).  Why do you need parity checking on a three foot long keyboard
cable?  Because collisions can occur since the lines are so overloaded with
signals with different meanings and parity provides the means for detecting
these collisions.

The AT documentation says that pin 3 is "reserved", so the keyboard has to
provide its own reset.  But on the original AT, pin 3 was still Reset and
IBM's own keyboards at that time needed Reset (original AT keyboards won't
work on some old clones because of this).  Don't ask me... I don't
understand why they did this.

The protocol on the keyboard interface is now much more complicated.  These
bytes are defined:
 
Commands

  ED <byte>                 Set leds depending on byte
                              bit 0 is Scroll lock
                              bit 1 is Num lock
                              bit 2 is Caps lock

  EE                        Echo EE (for testing?)
  F0 <mode>                 Select mode 1, 2 or 3
  F2                        Send keyboard I.D.
  F3 <byte>                 Set repeat delay and rate
                              byte is: 0ddbbaaa
                              delay is (dd+1)*250 msec
                              rate is (8+aaa)*2^bb*4 msec

  F4                        Clear buffer
  F5                        Restore default settings and wait for enable
  F6                        Restore default settings
  FA	                    Acknowledge
  FE                        Error- please retransmit
  FF                        Reset keyboard

Status returns

  00                        Buffer overflow
  AA                        Self-test passed
  F0 <scan-code>            Release code
  FA                        Acknowledge last command
  FD                        Self-test failed
  FC                        Self-test failed
  FE                        Last command in error; re-send
  E0 scan/release code      Extended keys in Mode 2

The computer and keyboard must acknowledge each command and key code with
either FA if there was no error, or FE if the last command/key-code should
be re-sent.  There are three modes of operation for the keyboard, depending
on which scan code assignments you want (these can often be set by a switch
on the back of keyboard, except that if mode 1 is selected from the switch,
the protocol is eliminated an the keyboard works exactly like an original XT
keyboard- newer keyboards only support modes 1 and 3).  In mode 1, the
keyboard gives XT scan-codes.  The keyboard handles the cursor keypad (which
didn't exist on the XT) by simulating pressing or releasing a shift key
(depending on whether shift or num-lock are pressed) and sending codes from
the numeric keypad.  Mode 2 works like mode 1, except that when the keyboard
does the weird stuff with the numeric keypad it prefixes everything with E0
and the release codes are the scan-codes prefixed with F0.  In mode 3, each
key gets a unique code and the release codes work as in mode 2: the release
are the scan-codes prefixed by F0.

When the AT keyboard is first reset it's supposed to send an AA if its
self-test passed or FD or FC if it failed.  But before it does this, it
sends a continual stream of AAs with the parity incorrect.  Once the
computer sends an FE to indicate that there is a parity error, the keyboard
stops sending bad AAs and sends a correct AA or an FD or FC.  This sounds
like someone made a quick fix in the keyboard firmware for mis-matched reset
timing (the keyboard always finishes resetting before the computer so the
computer could miss the AA/FD/FC).



Q) 3.24  Can I fake a keyboard so my computer will boot without it?

[From: jhallen@world.std.com (Joseph H Allen)]

() The IBM Keyboard - how do you use a computer without a keyboard?

Sometimes a PC needs to be set up as a "turn-key" system with no keyboard
for security reasons, or simply because the application doesn't need a
keyboard.  This causes a dead-lock problem when the system is booting: The
BIOS will detect that there is no keyboard and display the message "keyboard
failure - press F1 to continue," and the system becomes stuck.

There is usually a BIOS set-up option for disabling the keyboard test.
Check the manual for your motherboard.  If your BIOS does not have
this option, you're essentially screwed because there's no simple
solution.  You can't wire the DIN to fake the existence of a keyboard
since the BIOS checks for a self-test result code generated by the
keyboard.  You have to implement a small protocol (byte-by-byte
handshaking and ACK/NAK) to simulate a keyboard up to its self test.
There are adaptors available which contain a small microcontroller
programmed to do this.  Another solution is to replace your BIOS with
one which has the keyboard test disable option.  However, you have to
find one which matches your motherboard.

S) 4.0 Storage/Retrieval Devices

Q) 4.1  Why do I lose x Meg on my hard drive?
[From: Mike Long <mike.long@analog.com>]

The problem here is that there are two different measures of hard
drive storage, both called megabytes.  Computer hardware works on the
basis that one megabyte equals 2^20, or 1048576 bytes.  Hard drive
manufacturers, on the other hand, use a megabyte that has 1000000
bytes, because it makes the drive looks larger.  When buying a hard
drive, you should expect to lose almost 5% of what the manufacturer
claims the drive size to be.

The manufacturers are not totally at fault.  The first track of the
drive is used for the partition table and master boot record.  The
amount of data lost here depends on your drive parameters; usually
there are between 32 and 64 sectors (512 bytes/sector) on this first
track, so you lose between 16384 and 32768 bytes that way.

Additional space is taken up by two hidden files on your boot drive.
If you are running MS-DOS, these files are IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS.  If
you are running PC-DOS, the names are IBMIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM.

[From: ralf@wpi.wpi.edu (Ralph Valentino)]

Many drives these days advertise unformatted capacity.  The actual
formatted capacity may be significantly lower than this as space is
taken up marking tracks, sectors, CRC's, etc.  Exactly how much lower
depends on the the size of the sectors.  For instance, placing 1k
sectors on the disk instead of the usual 512 byte ones may slightly
increase the usable storage space on the disk.  Note, however, that
many OS's insist you stick to the 512 byte sectors so this option is
best left alone.

A large number of drives also do auto-mapping of bad sectors; when a
sector goes bad, it will automatically use a spare it kept aside
during the format.  This is very handy as the OS never needs to deal
with the problem and some OS's, like DOS, will mark a whole cluster
bad when a single sector goes bad.  These spare sectors, as many as
one per track, remain hidden from the OS but still take up space on
your hard drive.

When you get to drives larger than 1.0 gig (SCSI), many host adapter
BIOS's can not deal with this as the BIOS was never designed to handle
more than 1024 cylinders, 64 heads, and 32 sectors per track. (1024 *
64 * 32 * 512bytes/sec = 1.0 gig).  Luckily, some OS's (like OS/2)
ignore the BIOS all together and read the actual geometry from the
disk itself.  If, however, you're not using such an OS and you notice
that you only have 1.0 gig available, you may want to check with the
manufacturer of your SCSI host adapter to see if a newer BIOS is
available.


Q) 4.2  *Should I get an IDE/floppy/SCSI/parallel port tape drive?
Q) 4.3  I have two floppies. Can I add a floppy based tape drive?
 
[From: herbst@techunix.technion.ac.il (Herbst OMR)]

It depends. On all modern tape drives: yes. Some old tape drives
cannot do this (my old Jumbo). If you have one of these, you will have
to buy either a 4-floppy controller or a dedicated tape controller.

Q) 4.4  How fast is a tape drive? Will a dedicated controller improve this?

[From: herbst@techunix.technion.ac.il (Herbst OMR)]

The tape connected through a floppy interface is limited to the floppy
speed.  On ATs 500Kbit/S. On old XT 250Kbit/S. With card support for
2.88MB floppy, 1Mbit/S. Many of the newer cards support this transfer
rate.
 
If the card operate at 500Kbit/S, a dedicated controller card will
speed up the tape by a factor of two.  In many cases, those cards do
hardware compression, helping even more.

Q) 4.5  What is QIC80, QIC40?
 
[From: herbst@techunix.technion.ac.il (Herbst OMR)]

QIC stands for Quarter-Inch Cartridge. QIC80 is the standard for 80MB
tapes, QIC40 for 40MB tapes. Both standard allows for extended length
cassettes of 300ft which gives 120MB and 60MB respectively.

Q) 4.6  How come I can't fit as much stuff on my tape drive as they claim?

Most tape drives these days advertise capacity with an expected
compression ratio of 2:1.  If you are backing up compressed files
(.Z,.ZIP, .ARC, .JPEG, and so forth) then the drive's own compression
scheme will not be as effective.  For these cases, the actual capacity
of the tape will be closer to the "uncompressed" capacity.

A table from herbst@techunix.technion.ac.il (Herbst OMR) shows:

  stated capacity     standard        tape length         # tracks
 
  80MB                QIC40           200ft (normal)      15
  120MB               QIC40           300ft (extended)    15
  160MB (rarely)      QIC80           200ft               28
  250MB               QIC80           300ft               28
 
  For all the recording density is 12500 ftpi; max tape speed is 90 ips.

A second reason is that some tapes assume you will be taking full
advantage of their "streamers".  Streaming collects a number of tape
blocks and writes them all at once, preventing the need for backing up
the tape after each block.  This positions the blocks closer together
on the tape.  If your backup program is slow, some streamers won't be
quite as effective.  If you hear the tape drive motor backing up the
tape alot on writes, this could be the case.

Q) 4.7  Are Colorado/Conner/Archive/... tapes compatible with each other?

[From: herbst@techunix.technion.ac.il (Herbst OMR)] 

If you use the same software: Yes. If you want to use different
software, then turn compression off. Compression done in software on
those drives is not compatible.

Q) 4.8  How does the drive/software know how long the tape is?

[From: herbst@techunix.technion.ac.il (Herbst OMR)]
 
The magnetic tape has holes in it. Inside the cassette enclosure there
is a small mirror. The drive sends an IR beam through it. Near the end
of tape the drive receives it. If the IR receiver is dusted, the drive
may 'reel off' the cassette.

Q) 4.9  What are all those QICs?

[From: herbst@techunix.technion.ac.il (Herbst OMR)]

Q) 4.11  What is the CMOS/jumper setting for my hard drive?
[From: Carsten Grammes (cagr@rz.uni-sb.de)]

		    Configuration of IDE Harddisks
		    ==============================


last update: 24 March 1994

collected by Carsten Grammes (cagr@rz.uni-sb.de)
and published on comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware as part of the FAQ.



!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
There is explicitly NO WARRANTY that the given settings are correct or
harmless. (I only collect, I do not check for myself!!!). There is
always the possibility that the settings may destroy your hardware!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Since I hope however that only well-minded people undergo the effort of
posting their settings the chance of applicability exists. If you should
agree or disagree with some setting, let me know immediately in order
to update the list.

If you possess a HD not mentioned here of which you know BIOS and/or
jumper settings, please mail them to me for the next update of the list!

Only IDE (AT-Bus) Harddisks will be accounted for.  If not specified the
Landing Zone should be set equal to the number of cylinders. If not
specified the 'Write Precompensation' should be set 65535. (There are
BIOSes that don't even ask for it).  On most IDE disks these values are
dummies, relicts from old MFM times.

The capacity given here is sometimes in Megabytes (1000000 bytes) and
sometimes in MB (1048576 bytes). Don't worry! The only right way to calculate
the capacity is
    cyl * heads * sec/tr * 512 
which gives the capacity in bytes!  Dividing by 1000000 or 1048576 gives
the capacity in Megabytes or MB respectively.

If you get problems when installing 2 HD's with correct BIOS and jumper
settings, try to swap drive 1 and 2, often that helps.

Please don't flame me because of the 'layout' of the list. Since the
available information is so strongly varying I often only pack _YOUR_
mail to me into the list. If someone feels encouraged to improve this,
I would be glad to receive a 'lifted' version. But there should be all
info contained!

Since the list is rather long, I give here a summary of all drives
described therein.

Comment concerning CP3000 jumpers:

   According to your list, all Conners should be 2 or 3 jumpers only.
That's why I'm puzzled with the 4-jumper Conner CP-3000.
In addition to the common jumpers present in
Conner - C/D, DSP & ACT, there is an extra one: HSP
By trial and error, HSP seems to follow DSP setting.

and:
information: I am slaving a Conner CP3000 40Meg to a Western Digital
Caviar 2200 212 Meg.

the results: I first found out that pin 1 on the CP3000 was LABELED
INCORRECTLY on the PC board....had to flip the IDE cable (which made the
cable install much more cleanly- no flips....shoulda been my first clue
that something was not correct, oh well)

next: I had to DOS-format the CP3000 ALONE on the PC system before it
wanted to work with the WD caviar.... weird
also: the WD Caviar is partitioned: C:\ was the first 100 Meg and D:\ was
the second 100 Meg.  After the CMOS was correctly configured and the
drives brought online, the PC AUTOMATICALLY assigned the drives as thus:
C:\ first 100 Meg partition on the WD
D:\ 40 Meg Conner
E:\ second 100 Meg partition on the WD
even FDISK reports the above.

Subject: Re: Conner CP 30254

I tried several combination and even called Conner for info on
configuring two Conner drives as master (301??, a 300+ M Connder
drive) and slave (30254).  The jumpers that worked are:

		Pins 	Jumpers
Master		1-2	   Y 	 (factory setting)
	        3-4	   Y	 (factory setting)

Slave		1-2	   N
		3-4	   Y	 (factory setting)

So the C/D should mape to Y/N instead of N/Y in the table.

Some notes made whilst configuring a pair of Conner IDE drives
for Master/Slave operation from Hyundai Super-LT6 Laptop 386sx-20.

Final Working Configuration

Drive 1:	CP3000	40 Mb	Type 17
977 cyl 5 hds	17 sec/trk	Pre 300 LZ 977

Verified configuration as per Grammes' list. HSP does need to
follow DSP (empirically) - failure to do so produced behaviour
such as LCD screen display scrambling on ROM boot.

Single, Master and Slave configurations all checked out.

Drive 2:  CFA170A 170 Mb  Unknown type
332 cyl 16 hds	63 sec/trk	Pre --- LZ ---

Did not appear on Grammes' list. Successful configuration resulted
close to that shown as Table 3 for Conner drives, as follows:

	Single		2 links 	(not C)/D and (not A)/(?)
	Master		1 link		(not C)/D
	Slave		0 links

One link is listed here as (not A)/(?) due to a hole being drilled
through the (?) part of the silk screening ...

The drives worked together as either slave or master ...

Connor CP30101

Model CP342 disk (40 Meg IDE drive)
  Single Drive: E5, E7 jumpers IN
  Master Drive: E6, E7 jumpers IN
  Slave Drive:  E7 jumper IN

In addition, this is an old disk drive.  It was factory configured to
use 3:1 interleave.  This can cause timing problems with newer disk
drives that are configured for 1:1 interleave when using the same IDE
controller.  The CONNER tech support person suggested I only use the
CONNER drive as a SLAVE with the newer disk as the MASTER.

This configuration (MAXTOR 7345A as MASTER and CONNER CP342 as SLAVE)
has now been in use for over a week and seems to be working fine.

BIOS SETTINGS

BIOS setting for the M2614ET in my system is 667 cylinders, 33 sectors
and 16 heads.

> I was trying to set my IDE drive in the subject above to a slave drive for
> A Conner 170MB drive and contacting the support company gave me this answer (which works). The factory default on SW2 is On Off Off Off Off Off (1-6). This sets the drive to be a single drive. Setting SW2 to Off On On Off Off Off makes it a slave drive. SW1 has been set to On Off Off On (1-4) all along.



MODEL      CYLINDERS   HEADS    SECTORS   CAPACITY (Million bytes)

M2624T      995         16        63         513.51


There are 6 switches on the switch block on these drives.  Only 4 of 
them have a use that I am aware of (from my M2624T manual):

Master/Slave        Master (*)      SW1-5 OFF
                    Slave           SW1-5 ON
ECC bytes           4 bytes (*)     SW1-4 OFF
                    7 bytes         SW1-4 ON

IO Channel Ready    Disabled (*)    SW1-1 OFF
                    Enabled         SW1-1 ON

I have no idea about the function of SW1-2 and SW1-6.  The values 
listed with a (*) are the factory default settings.

There are two sets of jumpers. A set of 5 and a set of
4. With the power and IDE connector toward you, the set of 5 is
numbered (left to right) J16 - J20  , and the set of 4 is numbered
(bottom to top) J22-J25. 

The only jumper of normal interest is J20. Jumper it for only
drive in a single drive system, or master drive in a dual drive
system.
 
Remove the jumper J20 for slave drive in a dual drive system. 

J19 is a dummy and may be used to store the spare shunt if the 
drive is configured for a slave mode.

Jumpers J17, J18, J24, J25 are factory reserved. Abnormal operation
may occur if jumpered.

Jumper 22 is sync spindle enabled/disabled  (open=disabled)
Jumper 23 is sync slave/master              (open=slave)
Jumper 16 is I/O Channel Ready              (open=disabled)

 Technical Notes:
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The WPC and Landing Zone BIOS entieres do not need a specific number 
   for proper operation. Maxtor AT interface hard drives will ignore and
   override any numbers programmed.             

 * Drive is low-level formated with 1:1 interleave at factory, with any 
   defects retired to a dedicated non-destructive zone.
 
 * The drive's on-board controller will auto-translate every cylinder, 
   head, and SPT combination listed in the parameters table. Therefore, 
   configuration jumpers J13 and J14 are not required for most AT BIOS 
   setup applications.

 * The 7080A is shipped with J17-J20 jumered and the 7040A is shipped 
   with J18-J20 jumpered to operate as single AT IDE drives. J20 and J19 
   control master/slave operation.

Link Options

   In order to install the Rodime Ro 3000A series drives the dumpers for 
the single/dual drive and LED operation on the drive need to be set as 
described in the relevant product specification.
   I a single drive environment the drive is described as a Master.
   In a dual drive environment the drives are described as a Master and a
Slave. This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives 
when performing diagnostics.
   There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way 
interface connector. They have the following functions and are described 
in order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper 
described nearest the 40 way interface connector.

LK2: LED 
     When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the
     interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An
     external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with
     the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will
     be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130
     Ohms ot 220 Ohms.

LK1: Dual Drives
     This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single
     bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,
     indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave.

LK4: Master
     When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If
     there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be
     jumpered in this way.

LK5: IOChRdy
     When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is 
     fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher
     data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per
     second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally 
     fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per
     second.

   There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s)
may be jumpered:

     Master, single drive with LED on interface		LK2 & LK4 fitted.
     Master, single drive without LED on interface	LK4 only fitted.
     Master, dual drive without LED on interface	LK4 & LK1 fitted.
     Slave, dual drive without LED on interface		No jumpers fitted.
     Master, dual drive with LED on interface		LK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted.
     Slave, dual drive with LED on interface		LK2 only fitted.

   The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to
reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.

   The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way 
connector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected
by the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the 
drive for this LED driver. Refer to the product specification for further
details.

    HOST SLV/ACT, then this jumper must be installed, the ACT jumper must
    not be installed because the two jumpers are mutually exclusive

Manufacturer: Western Digital

(uses dynamic translation)
Jumpers:      CP MA SL

The drive runs as a slave with a WDAC2200 as master just fine.


Please note that these are the *recommended* CMOS parameters. All the disks 
support so-called dynamic translation, and should thus be able to work with
any parameters having fewer sectors than the total number of sectors on
the disk.

Now, according to the manual, the jumper settings are as follows:

Jumper                               CP   MA   SL
-------------------------------------------------
Single                                0    0    0

Slave                                 0    0    1
Slave with Conner CP342 or CP3022     1    0    1   


Maybe there are 2 kinds of Caviar's floating around: 

If your jumpers read MA SL and SI then use:
Jumper	SI	MA	SL
Single	1	0	0
Master	0	1	0
Slave	0	0	1

There have been reported difficulties in using WD Caviar as Master and
NEC drives as slave - the other way it works.

> (203 MB) as slave, both with and without the "CP" jumper, the Caviar had

S) 5.0 Video

Q) 5.1  Can I use two video cards in the same system?
[From: uwvax!astroatc!nicmad!madnix!zaphod (Ron Bean)]

   In the past, the only way to do this was to use one Hercules-type
monochrome card and one color card (CGA, EGA, or VGA), because the
color cards all used the same address space.  Most DOS software will
only use one at a time (you can switch between them with the 'mode'
command), but debuggers and CAD programs often support this type of
dual-display system. You may have to change a setting on your VGA card
to make it run in 8-bit mode in order for this to work.
 
   Windows can also be set up this way. Include the line
DualDisplay=TRUE (or ON) in your SYSTEM.INI file, in the 386enh
section. If you open a DOS shell window and type MODE MONO, the shell
will appear on the monochrome monitor.
 
   There are now other types of video cards that don't share the VGA
address space, but these combinations don't seem to be supported by
software. Some types that have been suggested include TIGA, 8514A,
Hercules InColor, and a few other "accelerated" cards. Many EISA video
cards have fully addressable video apertures, and come with the
appropriate drivers.
 
   A few cards contain more than one VGA chipset and come with special
drivers that make it behave like a single VGA card, but they may be
expensive and hard to find.
 
   If you just want to display the same image on several monitors,
there are (expensive) signal splitters that will do this (try vendors
that specialize in things like cables and switchboxes). Signal
splitters for EGA/CGA are somewhat cheaper.



Q) 5.2  *What kinds of monitors are available?

Q) 5.3  How can I get a fixed frequency monitor to work on my PC?
[From: hughes@cat.rpi.edu (Declan Hughes)]

A frequently asked question is how to use a fixed frequency monitor
(often a Sony or Sun monitor) with a PCAT. Two companies that provide
the required video cards are:

 1. Mirage Computer Systems
    4286 Lincoln Blvd.,
    Marina Del Rey,
    CA 90292
    tel: 1-310-301-4541
    fax: 1-310-301-4546

 2. Software Integrators
    104 East Main st.,
    Suite 206,
    Bozeman,
    MT 59715
    tel: 1-406-586-8866
    fax: 1-406-586-9145

Mirage make video cards that support all single frequency/high
frequency monitors that operate between 28-35Khz, 47-52Khz, 60-65Khz
and 70-78Khz at specific VGA, EGA and DOS modes (various drivers are
included) with ISA, Vesa local bus & PCI local bus interfaces. They
also have fast drivers for specific software products such as Autocad,
3D Studio and Windows 3.1 etc.

For example, a STORM 1280/256 will drive a Sony GDM-1950 at 640x480,
800x600, 1024x768, 1280x1024 and DOS modes (this monitor is rated at
63.34Khz Horizontal sync. and the card runs at 64Khz Horizontal
sync.). This card uses an S3 graphics accelerator. See also PC
Magazine/April/13/1993.

Software Integrators make similar video cards (the MERCURY X1 Series)
that will also support CGA modes as well as DOS, EGA and VGA modes
using the S3 801 graphics accelerator and again they also make fast
drivers for specific products such as Autocad, 3D Studio and Windows
3.1 etc.

These cards work with all fixed scan monitors including, IBM,
Mitsubishi, Hitachi, Sony, Sun, HP, Verticom, DEC, Taxan, Philips,
Apollo, Silicon Graphics, Intergraph, Aydin, Amtron, Monotronix,
etc. and will replace aold boards from, Artist, Number9, Nth,
Verticom, Photon, BNW, VMI, Matrox, Metheus, Mirage, Graphax,
Imagraph, TAT etc.

Both companies can supply interface cables such as a 15pin male VGA to
5 BNC connector.

I have gleaned this information from sales sheets faxed to me, I am
purchasing one of these cards, I am not related to either company, and
both sales staff were very helpful (so please ask them for more
detailed information).

I was also informed of a German manufacturer ELSA that makes similar cards,
but I do not know of their address or product range.



Q) 5.4  What is 24 bit color/true color?

The color of a pixel is formed by mixing three colors: Red, Green and
Blue.  The amount of each of these colors ranges from 0 to 255, an 8
bit value.  So, the total number of unique colors available is 16.7
million (2 ^ 24).

With a "normal" SVGA video card, you can pick any 256 of these colors
(called a palette) to display on the screen at a time.  If your picture
has more than 256 unique colors, various methods can be used to come
up with the 256 closest colors.

A 24 bit color (aka 'true color') card doesn't have this limitation,
it can display any of the 16.7 million possible colors at a time.
Since it doesn't have to use close colors, it displays the true
picture colors, thus the name 'true color'.  Note that many picture
formats, including GIF, also have the 256 color limitation, so a true
color card won't improve the picture viewing at all.  More recent
picture formats, such as JPEG, support 24 bit color.

Q) 5.5  Can I use a 64/128 bit card in on an ISA/EISA/VLB/PCI bus?

Yes, the 64 or 128 bit bus on these cards is internal to the card
and has nothing to do with the bus interface.


Q) 5.6  *Can I get an RGB monitor to work with my PC?

Q) 5.7  *How can I hook more than one monitor to my video card?

Q) 5.8  *Which video card is best for DOS/Windows/X11/OS2?

Q) 5.9  *What is the black horizontal line on my monitor?

S) 6.0 Systems

Q) 6.1  *What should I upgrade first?

Q) 6.2  Do I need a CPU fan / heat sink

[From: jruchak@mtmis1.mis.semi.harris.com (John Anthony Ruchak)]

This is highly debatable.  In general, if you buy from a good,
self-respecting company, any additional cooling requirements would
have been taken care of before your system was delivered to you.
 
I'm responsible for PC maintenance at my site, and I don't worry about
additional cooling in any of the pre-packaged systems we receive.  All
rebuilt and/or upgraded 486-33 (or higher) systems do, however,
receive additional cooling because older cases may not provide
adequate ventilation for today's technology.  Additional cooling on
the infamously-hot Pentium (586) is always added.

So, do YOU need a CPU fan in YOUR system?  Probably not for "ready to
run out of the box systems."  If you are _REALLY_ worried that your
system is suffering from too much heat, consult with a reputable
service center.  They will not only answer your questions, but they
can also install any additional cooling systems that may be needed.  A
good rule of thumb, though - "don't try to fix what isn't broken."
In other words, if your system is working, don't look for trouble.

Q) 6.3  What does the turbo switch do?

[From: cls@truffula.sj.ca.us (Cameron L. Spitzer)]

It slows your system down so you can play games that were written
with timing mechanisms based on CPU execution rate.  I know of three
implementations:
1.  A programmable divider delivers the clock signal at two different
    speeds.
2.  Extra wait states are inserted in all memory cycles.
3.  Dummy DMA cycles or extra referesh cycles are inserted.
The first is by far the most common.

Q) 6.4  How does the front panel LED display measure the system's speed?

It doesn't.  The only useful information going to these displays is if
you are in turbo mode.  They have jumpers or dials behind the display
which you can use to set them to show any two arbitrary numbers (for
turbo and non-turbo modes).

Q) 6.5  Should I turn my computer/monitor off?

Turning a device on/off causes thermal stress.  Leaving it on causes
wear and tear (even on non moving parts).  The only thing you
shouldn't do is quickly power cycle the computer.  If you turn it
on/off, leave it that way for at least a few seconds.  Other than
that, it's up to you.

Q) 6.6  Are there any manufacturers/distributers who read the net?

Yes, it is known that Zeos, Gateway 2000, Dell, Adaptec, HP and others
all read the net to some extent.  However, for best results, use the
support phone numbers.

S) 8.0 Misc

Q) 8.1  What is the pin out for ...?
[From: ralf@wpi.wpi.edu (Ralph Valentino)]

This is a list of the pinouts to the more common PC hardware
interfaces.  It is by no means complete.  While I have taken care not
to make any mistakes, I urge you to take caution when using these
tables.  Also, please keep in mind that these are only tables, they
are not a guide to hardware hacking and do not attempt to explain
drive capabilities, signal timings, handling care, or other interface
issues.  As always, make sure you know what you're doing before you
start hooking wires to your PC.

Q) 8.2  *Where are benchmark programs located. What do they mean?

Q) 8.3  What is Plug and Play?

[From: leefi@microsoft.com (Lee Fisher)]

Plug and Play is the name of a technology that lets PC hardware and attached
devices work together automatically, reducing end-user complexity. Plug and
Play technology is implemented in hardware, in operating systems, and in
supporting software such as drivers and in the systemboard's BIOS. Microsoft
will support Plug and Play starting with Windows "Chicago" and Windows NT
"Cairo". Today there is a solution for MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows 3.x using
software from Intel which works with the Plug and Play hardware. There are a
variety of Plug and Play technologies, today including BIOS, ISA cards, SCSI,
IDE CD-ROM, PCMCIA, drivers.

Many specifications are available via anonymous ftp at 
ftp.microsoft.com:/drg/Plug-and-Play.

Email the PlayList@Microsoft.COM alias to get on a list for announcements
regarding new specifications, informations on workshops, etc.

The Compuserve Plug and Play forum (GO PLUGPLAY) is available for technical
support issues regarding hardware and driver design issues.

For more related information, on ftp.microsoft.com, see 
/drg/Plug-and-Play/readme and /drg/Developer-Info/devinfo.zip.

Microsoft is starting a "Plug and Play Hardware Catalog" to showcase Plug and
Play hardware, entries are being accepted for the initial issue. Send hardware

Q) 8.4  What size should I set my DOS partitions to be?
[From: Mike Long <mike.long@analog.com>]
[Some corrections by: Osmo Ronkanen <ronkanen@cc.helsinki.fi>]

This depends on what cluster size you want.  A smaller cluster size is
better, because a small file takes up a whole cluster if there is even
one byte in it; the leftover space is called "slack."  If you have N
files on your drive, and your cluster size is S bytes, then you can
expect to lose N*S/2 bytes to slack space on the average.

The table below shows the maximum partition size to get clusters of a
given size.  You cannot format a hard drive under DOS with a cluster
size less than 2K.

+-------------------+-----------+-------+
|   Cluster size    | Partition |  FAT  |  Notes
|                   |   size    | type  |
+-------------------+-----------+-------+
|  4K  (4096 bytes) |     16 MB | FAT12 |
|  2K  (2048 bytes) |     32 MB | FAT16 | (DOS versions < 4.0)
|  2K  (2048 bytes) |    128 MB | FAT16 | (DOS versions >= 4.0)
|  4K  (4096 bytes) |    256 MB | FAT16 |
|  8K  (8192 bytes) |    512 MB | FAT16 |
| 16K (16384 bytes) |      1 GB | FAT16 |
| 32K (32768 bytes) |      2 GB | FAT16 |
| 64K (65536 bytes) |      4 GB | FAT16 |
+-------------------+-----------+-------+

Another consideration is backup.  If you backup to tape, you should
have disk partitions smaller than the capacity of a single tape for
ease in backup.

[From: Osmo Ronkanen <ronkanen@cc.helsinki.fi>]

The 32 MB limit actually didn't have anything to do with the
cluster size or FAT it was because the number of sectors in
the partition was stored in boot record as a 16 bit number. 



Q) 8.5  Why won't my system boot from the hard drive?

If you can boot from a floppy and see the files on your hard drive,
then chances are there's something wrong with your MBR (Master Boot
Record) / partition table.  The first thing you should try is: "FDISK
/MBR".  This will fix the master boot record without effecting the
contents of your disk.  If this doesn't work, the next thing to try is
verifying that you have your Primary DOS Partition set active.  To do
this, enter "FDISK" and chose "Set active partition" (usually the
second option) then pick "Primary DOS Partition".  Then exit and
reboot.  This too will not effect the contents of your disk.

The next thing to try is replacing the files required for DOS to boot;
they may have been corrupted or deleted.  To do this, run "SYS C:".
This may or may not be possible as DOS versions before 5.0 required
these files be located at a certain place on your hard drive and that
spot may no longer be available.  Either way, this will not otherwise
effect the contents of your disk.

If neither of these things work, then the next thing to try is
reformatting your hard drive (FORMAT C: /SYS).  Note that this will
erase all of the files on your hard drive, so back up anything you
want to save first!!!  If all three of these suggestions fail, then
chances are you have a more serious problem.

Q) 8.6  How do I clean my computer?

Clean the outside with a damp (not wet) cloth with a mild dish washing
detergent after unplugging the system.  Let it dry completely before
plugging your system in.  Do not clean the inside - computer
components are not susceptible to common house hold dust.  Unless you
have special equipment, you will more likely cause more harm than help
to your computer if you try.

Q) 8.7  *What OS's are available for the PC? Which are free?

[this section being worked on]

Q) 8.8  *How can I transfer files between my PC and a Unix system?

[this section being worked on]

Q) 8.9  What tape backup software is available?

[From: herbst@techunix.technion.ac.il (Herbst OMR)]

 JUMBO TAPE
 ----------
Small. Not many features but does the job. Seems to work only with
Colorado drives.  Latest version is 4.03 and can be found by Archie
jumbo403.zip.

>From "Stan Faullin":
 
Useful DOS program.  Has very basic Backup (total, modified,
selected), Restore, Compare, Erase and Format functions.  Some
versions come with a Windows scheduler, but it will NOT run in the
background in a DOS window.  The compression scheme used in some
previous versions is NOT compatible with their latest release, so you
may not be able to read backups made with version 3.x with version
4.x.  Separate versions of this software are available for their
internal model or the parallel port model.
 
Windows:
 
The Lite version supports both parallel port versions and internal
versions.  The only Windows backup program for a parallel port device,
but only supports the Colorado Trakker unit.  Can run in the

CMS Trakker 250 is supplied with a "generic" software package:
it performs backup, restore, selective backup & restore, compression,
compare. It works with DOS and Windows 3.1. 
For an additional $49.95 ($39?) you can purchase their fancier version.
 
 Central-Point backup
 --------------------
Large with many, many features and confusing directory
selections. Works with most drives.

 Conner Basic 1.0
 ----------------
>From "Moshe Braner   braner@emba.uvm.edu":
useless -- only backs up entire drive.
 
 Conner Basic 1.1
 ----------------
>From: pjk@netcom.com (Phil Koenig)

If you got the low-power backup software bundled in -- Conner Backup
Basics -- and it is V1.0, you are entitled to a free upgrade from Conner.
The new version has an only slightly better addendum to the manual, but
the software now is about as flexible as most users would want -- partial
backup and restore by directory or file, etc.  It has worked well for us,
and I recommend that you ask for your copy.
 
>From: dmiller@im.lcs.mit.edu (Dick and Jill Miller)
 
I emphasize that v1.1 of Conner Backup Basics fixes many of the prior
problems, although its prompts, on-line help and printed documentation 
still deserve improvement.
 
 Conner Exec
 -----------
>From "Moshe Braner   braner@emba.uvm.edu":
 
Very large (2.5 megs for DOS version, windows version even larger).
Did not work with my parallel-port Conner 250meg QIC-80 drive.

 QICstream==Conner "Simply Safe Software Backup Basics version 3.0P"
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
Small and works fine. Works with parallel port Conner drive.
 
 Symantec Norton Backup
 ----------------------
This is included with Norton Desktop for Windows, which is a much
better deal than purchasing Norton Backup for Windows alone.

Q) 8.10  Why doesn't my new device work as fast as it should?

The performance of individual components in your system are highly
dependent the rest of your system.  For instance, the transfer rate of
drives, usually measured in megabytes per second, can depend on the
drive controller, bus type and OS.  Video card speed, sometime
measured in Winmarks, highly depends on the speed of your main CPU as
well as the OS.  When ever you see a statement on the speed of the
device, be sure to check the small print to determine what type of
system and under what conditions the speed was measured.  Don't be
fooled by benchmark numbers.  Another important corollary of this is
*never* post benchmarks - they offer little to no information for
comparison with other systems.  Benchmarks are only useful for
comparison purposes when run in a controlled environment, and even
then to a limited degree.

Q) 8.11  My drive lists a MTBF of 300,000 hours. Will it really last 34 years?

[From: swwalters@fl51mail.space.honeywell.com  (Steve Walters)]

Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) is a statistical calculation
indicating the mean time between randomly occurring hardware failures.
Two parameters are necessary to fully describe how long a piece of
hardware will last.  The first parameter is MTBF which is a measure of
frequency in which random hardware failures will occur.  The second
parameter is mean operating life which defines how long the hardware
will last before an anticipated wearout phenomena will occur.  These
two parameters combined together give the true projection of the
'real' life of the drive.  As an example of how these parameters
interrelate, assume your drive has an MTBF of 300,000 hours and an
operating life of 5 years.  The drive will operate uninterrupted until
failure (such as a file server, for example).  This is telling you
that your drive should be very reliable until wearout occurs since the
MTBF greatly exceeds the mean life.  However, after 5 years (on the
average), expect it to fail due to wearout.  In this example, the
actual chances of the drive lasting 3 years is 92%, 4 years is 88%, 5
years is 56% and 6 years is 35%.

Q) 8.12  How do I find pin 1 on my chip/card/cable/connector?

Pin 1 is always marked in one way or another to avoid confusion due to
symmetry (after which known numbering schemes can be used).  The most
important thing to note is that the orientation of the letters or
numbers printed on the chip have absolutely nothing to do with the
actual orientation of the pins.  Never assume that all chips should be
readable from the same angle!

The most obvious marking for pin 1 is a small number '1'.  The first
thing you should do is look very carefully for it.  Ribbon cables are
often marked with a blue or red stripe on pin 1.  Some chips are
marked with a dot, notch or small angled cut in the material just
above pin 1.  Rectangular chips are usually marked with a notch on one
of ends; the first pin counter clockwise from this notch is pin 1.  If
you can't find a marking on the socket or connector, then try looking
at the pads (the holes in the board the socket or connector is
soldered into).  For through-hole devices, pin 1 has a square pad, the
rest should be round.

Q) 8.13  I've run out of power connectors, what can I do?

Assuming your power suply is actually strong enough to power all of
your devices, you can pick up a Y-adapter at your local Radio Shack.

Q) 9.2  What do the industry acronyms stand for?
[From ralf@wpi.wpi.edu (Ralph Valentino)]

This is a list of 280+ acronyms which commonly come up in discussion
of hardware.  It does not contain abbreviations or names that don't
stand for anything, nor does it attempt to explain exactly what the
technology does, where it can be found, nor even how to use it in a
sentence.  So, is it completely useless?  Well, sometimes just knowing
what an acronym stands for is enough to tell you what people are
talking about or where to go to get more information about it.

If anyone has any additions, comments, or corrections, please forward
them to me directly.  Keep in mind that I have tried to avoid software
topics except where they overlap with hardware ones, so don't bother
telling me what BASIC stands for as it is outside the scope of this
list.

Q) 9.3  Where can I get the ISA/EISA/VLB/PCI/etc specs?

PCMCIA
1030 East Duane Avenue, Suite G
Sunnyvale CA 94086
Tel 408-720-0107
Fax 408-720-9416

They are in my mind necessary if you want to write programs that use Socket
Services or Card Services, but maybe not necessary for designing hardware.
A bit pricey they are.

Q) 9.4  What books are available for the PC architecture?

Edward Solari
_ISA & EISA_ Theory and Operation
Annabooks, San Diego CA USA
ISBN 0-929392-15-9

This is an excellent book on the EISA and ISA architectures.
Everything you need to know to make your own card, from timing to ECU
config files.

Tom Shanley
_EISA System Architecture_
MindShare, Inc, Richardson, TX USA
ISBN 1-881609-03-0

This book is good for an overview of the EISA and, in part, ISA
systems.  It doesn't go into enough detail to design boards from, but,
as a quote from the sleeve says "The co-ops in the group have found
them to be especially useful."

Tom Shanley
_PCI System Architecture_
MindShare, Inc, Richardson, TX USA
ISBN 1-881609-06-5

[From: cls@truffula.sj.ca.us (Cameron Spitzer):

Edward Solari
_AT Bus Design_
Annabooks, San Diego CA USA
ISBN 0-929392-08-6

This book describes the expansion slot which appeared in IBM's
Personal Computer AT.  This bus is now known as the Industry Standard
Architecture Bus, or just ISA.  It gives enough functional and timing
detail for the hardware designer to ensure a new Adapter's
compatibility.  It does not discuss any of the defacto-standard
Adapters, peripherals, or BIOS features, and gives only an overview of
the memory and IO layout.  The timing details are for the nominal 8
MHz bus clock.  Recent practice of drastically increasing this clock
rate is not discussed.

[From: Shaun Burnett (burnesa@cat.com)]

Scott Mueller
_Upgrading and Repairing PCs, 2nd ed._
QUE
ISBN 0-88022-856-3

I've found the following book to be an excellent reference on the PC.
It discusses the IBM PC family and various peripherals.  The book is
written so that the novice user will find this book of use.  Those
that deal with PCs on a lower level will appreciate the numerous
tables that contains information on such topics as serial port
pin-outs, bus connection labels, and I/O ports addresses.

  it does include some pretty good info on their notebooks/laptops

  other servers but I was asked to use their new server (above); it will
  go online between the 15th and 18th of January.

  supported but it does give some good info on their products.
