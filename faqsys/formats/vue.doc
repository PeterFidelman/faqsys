Autodesk 3D Studio
                        .VUE file format

The .VUE file is an ASCII file which acts as a script for the
Renderer during command-line rendering.  Command line/batch file
rendering is described in the Readme.doc file included on the
Autodesk 3D Studio release disks.  Creation of the .VUE file is
described on page 8-113 of the Autodesk 3D Studio Reference
Manual.

The following document describes the commands and arguements
contained in the .VUE file.

The .VUE file describes a sequence of frames to be rendered. 
Each frame is described by a sequence of commands beginning with
a "frame" command, specifying the frame number, and ending with a
viewport command describing the view to be rendered (e.g., "top,"
"camera," etc.).  Between these two command are any number of
"transform", "light", "spotlight", and "morph" commands.

The .VUE file commands are as follows

     frame     <n>       
     transform <object name> <transform matrix>
     morph     <master object name> <morph number> <object 1
               name> <weight 1> ... <object N name> <weight N>
               <transform matrix>
     light     <light name> <x> <y> <z> <r> <g> <b>
     spotlight <light name> <x> <y> <z> <tox> <toy> <toz> <r> <g>
               <b> <hot angle> <falloff angle> <shadow flag>
     top       <x> <y> <z> <width>
     bottom    <x> <y> <z> <width>
     left      <x> <y> <z> <width>
     right     <x> <y> <z> <width>
     front     <x> <y> <z> <width>
     back      <x> <y> <z> <width>
     camera    <x> <y> <z> <tox> <toy> <toz> <roll> <focal> 

Examples of how the above commands are formatted can found by
creating your own .VUE files in Autodesk 3D Studio. The following
section describes each of these commands and their values.

Frame command (begins each frame description with the frame
number):

     frame  <n>               

Transform command (move the object to a given orientation and
display):

     transform <object name> <transform matrix>

          <object name>  is the name corresponding to one of the
                         objects in the corresponding .3DS file,
                         in double quotes.

          <transform matrix> is composed of 12 numbers:

                    r1 r2 r3 r4 r5 r6 r7 r8 r9 tx ty tz
     
               The first nine numbers, r1-r9, describe the
               rotation and scaling to apply to the object.  The
               last three, tx,ty,tz, describe its position in
               universe coordinates.    

Morphing command (display weighted average of up to four objects
-- objects must have same number of vertices):

     morph <master object name> <morph number> <object 1 name>
     <weight 1> <object 2 name> <weight 2>...<object N name>
     <weight N> <transform matrix>

          <master object name>     is the name of the master
                                   object, from which surface
                                   properties are derived.

          <morph number>           is the number of objects to
                                   average: 2, 3, or 4.

          <object 1 name>          is the name of the first
                                   object to be averaged.

          <weight 1>               is weight to be applied to the
                                   first object.

          <object N name>          is the name of the Nth object
                                   to be averaged.

          <weight N>               is weight to be applied to the
                                   Nth object (up to four).

          <transform matrix>       (See above.)
     

     Note: The weights are decimal fractions (0 - 1.0)
     representing averages of the up to four morphed objects on
     either side of the current frame.  Each of these numbers
     describes how much of the object in the current frame is
     made up of the other four objects.  In most cases, the total
     of these numbers will be 1.0.
