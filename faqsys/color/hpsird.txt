Hi all,

I've included, below, an ascii encoded HP48 directory with the
random-dot autostereogram stuff in it for your visualization pleasure.
The directory contains five things.

EXAMP1 & EXAMP2
are standard-sized grobs with simple stereograms on which to
practice your viewing.

RDAFUN
is the main program. It takes a user-defined function of two variables
and generates the stereogram on the '48 screen. It takes a while but I
have found that you can begin seeing the 3-D effect after it's about 1/3
done.

The user-defined function should take screen coordinates 
( [1,131]X[1,64] ) and return an INTEGER (!!!) between 0 and 8. This
upper limit was experimentally determined as the useful dynamic range
- but try messing around yourself.

ONEPIX
is the routine to "color" a single pixel based on the past history and
current function value.

RNDLST
is a utility to generate a random sequence of 0's and 1's.

Beyond the end of the directory, I've included an FAQ regarding RDAs from
a usenet notes group.

----- How Stereograms Work --------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's start with a simple repeating pattern.  First we'll examine viewing
stereograms wall-eyed (focusing beyond the picture).

              Adam
Adam                       Adam          <-- PERCEIVED IMAGE (3D)
  \ 
   \ \
    \   \
    Adam  Adam   Adam  Adam              <-- ACTUAL PICTURE (Flat, 2D)
     \       \
      \         \                        <-- LINES OF SIGHT FROM EACH EYE
       \           \
       (*)           (*)                 <-- EYES

As shown in the above graphic, the lines of sight go through different
(but identical) words.  The eyes must be directed to just the right level
behind the picture to get the two "Adams" to line up.  When they do line 
up, a single "Adam" appears at the level shown behind the picture.  

This is why it is easiest for some people to look at stereograms behind
glass.  You simply look at your reflection, which appears to be behind
the glass at about the same level as the 3d stereogram image.  More on
this later.

So, why is the second "Adam" in the above image "deeper" than the other
two?  Since the next two "Adams" that line up are FARTHER apart than the
first two, your eyes must diverge a little more to get them to line up.  
As the eyes diverge, their lines of sight meet a little further away.
This causes the next "Adam" to appear deeper in the image.

              Adam
Adam           |           Adam          <-- PERCEIVED IMAGE (3D)
              / \
             /   \
            /     \
    Adam  Adam   Adam  Adam              <-- ACTUAL PICTURE (Flat, 2D)
           /       \
          /         \                    <-- LINES OF SIGHT FROM EACH EYE
         /           \
       (*)           (*)                 <-- EYES

The above graphic was crammed into 10 lines of text.  If we moved the 
eyes back (to a more realistic distance), the whole 3d image would 
appear deeper, and not so spread out.

Cross-eyed viewing follows the same principles, but brings the focal point
up front of the picture and inverts the image.  I'll use the same eyes and
picture, but move the eyes back for room to illustrate.

    Adam  Adam   Adam  Adam              <-- ACTUAL PICTURE (Flat, 2D)
       \   |
         \|
         Adam                            <-- PERCEIVED IMAGE (3D)
         |   \
         |     \
        |         \                      <-- LINES OF SIGHT FROM EACH EYE
        |           \
       (*)           (*)                 <-- EYES

Now for the inverse part.  Since the next two "Adams" are farther apart,
you must cross your eyes MORE (converge instead of diverge your eyes) to
get the "Adams" to overlap.  This causes the next "Adam" in the image to
appear closer than the first one.

    Adam  Adam    Adam  Adam             <-- ACTUAL PICTURE (Flat, 2D)
           \      /
            \    /
         Adam\ / Adam                    <-- PERCEIVED IMAGE (3D)

         /          \
       (*)           (*)                 <-- EYES

Whew.  Ascii graphics are a bit too tight to be very technical.  By the
way, each letter (or pixel) in the 3D image comes from two letters in
the picture.  Stereograms have blurry edges (right and left edges) 
because the line of sight from the one eye passes through the picture, 
but the line of sight from the other eye is off the picture.  Examine
the wall-eyed example below.

                     Adam
       Adam                       Adam     <-- PERCEIVED IMAGE (3D)
\               
  \ \
    \   \
       \   Adam  Adam   Adam  Adam         <-- ACTUAL PICTURE (Flat, 2D)
         \     \
            \       \                      <-- LINES OF SIGHT
              \           \          
              (*)           (*)            <-- EYES

Here, the line of sight for the right eye goes through first "Adam" 
in the picture, and the line of sight for the left eye is off the
picture.  (Everything to the left of the first "Adam" in the IMAGE 
is blurry.)


HOW TO GENERATE STEREOGRAMS

Random stereograms work the same way; they simple repeat random text or
pixels, instead of words like the "Adam" used above.  Below, the pattern, 
"ASDFGHJK", is repeated four times in each line.  (I duplicated it for
easier viewing.)

         ASDFGHJKASDFGHJKASDFGHJKASDFGHJK
         ASDFGHJKASDFGHJKASDFGHJKASDFGHJK
         ASDFGHJKASDFGHJKASDFGHJKASDFGHJK

As you might guess, the image consists of THREE repetitions of the 
pattern, set back behind the picture (wall-eyed).  To add some varying
depth to the image, we can simple add a space in the middle; or better,
we'll add a different letter, the letter Q.  I've also dropped the K
off the end to keep it suitable for framing. :-)

         ASDFGHJKASDFGHJKASDFGHJKASDFGHJK
         ASDFGHJKASDFGHJKASQDFGHJKASDFGHJ
         ASDFGHJKASDFGHJKASDFGHJKASDFGHJK

Adding the Q has the same effect as adding the space between "Adams"
in the previous example.  Here it is again for comparison.

         Adam Adam Adam Adam Adam Adam
         Adam Adam Adam  Adam Adam Ada
         Adam Adam Adam Adam Adam Adam

These two stereograms demonstrate going down a level (deeper, for wall-
eyed viewers) by adding a new letter where you want to go down.  The
image returns back to the original level because the added letter was
not repeated down the line; it was essentially deleted again.  Hence,
deleting a letter causes the image to come forward one level.  Lets 
look at this by deleting a letter before adding any.

         ASDFGHJKASDFGHJKASDFGHJKASDFGHJK
         ASDFGHJKASDFGJKASDFGHJKASDFGHJKA
         ASDFGHJKASDFGHJKASDFGHJKASDFGHJK

I deleted an H from the middle row, and added an A on the end to make
it flush again.  This causes the image to come up a level where the H
was deleted, then go back down where the H returns to the pattern.

To fully control the ups and downs of stereogram generation, you simply
keep track of what's repeating and add and delete letters when needed.
For example, start with the pattern ASDFGHJK.  If the input for the 3D
stereogram image is 00000000000011111222221111111110000, where the 
numbers represent the levels of the 3D image, you simply delete a letter
from the pattern when you go up a level (0 to 1, or 1 to 2), and add a
letter to the pattern when you go down a level (2 to 1, or 1 to 0).

If you want to go up multiple levels, e.g., from level 1 to 3, delete
2 letters from your pattern.  Adding two letters to the pattern likewise
causes a two level drop in the image.

Start each line by dumping the whole pattern before you start creating
the image.  Recall that in the examples above, four "Adams" in the 
picture creates three "Adams" in the image.  By dumping the pattern to
start, we are simple providing the first "Adam" to build the 3D image
from.  Now, we start building the 3D image.

        ASDFGHJK

Since the first 12 levels are at level 0, we do no adding nor deleting;
just dump 12 more letters from the pattern in order.

        ASDFGHJKASDFGHJKASDF
                ^image starts here

We now have our first transition, from level 0 to 1.  Which letter do we
delete?  Delete the next one in the pattern.  

        ASDFGHJK
            ^the next letter in the pattern

Since G is next, we delete it.  Our new pattern is ASDFHJK, and H is the
next letter to be used in the image.

        ASDFHJK
            ^the next letter to use in the image

Forget about the G.  Consider it gone forever.  The input now indicates 
five letters at level 1.  Since we made the transition to level one by 
deleting the G, we simply copy the next 5 letters from the pattern into
the image.  The next 5 letters in the pattern are HJKAS.  (You've noticed
by now that we wrap around when we get to the end of the pattern.) I'll 
lay the input next to our image to make it easier to see where we're at.

                00000000000011111222221111111110000
        ASDFGHJKASDFGHJKASDFHJKAS
        {      }{          }{   }
        initial  level 0    level
        pattern             1

To jump up to level 2 from level 1, we delete the next letter in the 
pattern, the letter D.  The new pattern is shown below.

        ASFHJK
          ^the next letter to use

We have 5 letters at level 2, so we copy the next 5 letters from the 
pattern, FHJKA, to the image.

                00000000000011111222221111111110000
        ASDFGHJKASDFGHJKASDFHJKASFHJKA
        {      }{          }{   }{   }
        initial  level 0    lev  level
        pattern             1    2

We must now move down a level, from 2 to 1, by ADDING a letter to our
pattern.  Where do we add it?  Add it as the next letter to use.  Let's
add an X (randomly chosen letters work better than previously used 
letters).  Since A was the last letter used, S is the next to be used.

        ASFHJK
         ^add X here

        AXSFHJK
         ^next letter to use

Since there are nine letters at level 1, we must copy nine letters 
from the pattern to the image (XSFHJKAXS).

                00000000000011111222221111111110000
        ASDFGHJKASDFGHJKASDFHJKASFHJKAXSFHJKAXS

        initial  level 0    lev  level level 1
        pattern             1    2

Drop another level, from 1 to 0, by adding another letter to the pattern
at the current position.

        AXSFHJK
           ^add random letter (M) here

        AXSMFHJK
           ^next letter to use

Since there are four letters at level 0, we copy four letters from the
pattern to the image (MFHJ).

                00000000000011111222221111111110000
        ASDFGHJKASDFGHJKASDFHJKASFHJKAXSFHJKAXSMFHJ

        pattern             1    2     1       0

WE'RE DONE.  Kinda anti-climatic, huh?  Let's duplicate the image line
to make it easier to view.

For each new line in the image, start with a new random pattern, and
follow the steps above.  So, how are graphics stereograms made?  The
same way, using colored pixel values for input.  3drandot uses RED as
the color deepest in the image, with GREEN in the middle, and BLUE as
the highest color.

The pseudocode below follows this algorithm.  If you have any questions,
post them in the newsgroup.  Let me know if you are interested in C code 
that follows this algorithm.  The C code here in the FAQ follows a 
different algorithm, the "lookback" algorithm.

Enjoy!!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
----- STEREOGRAM ALGORITHM --------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following is an algorithm I developed for SIRDS generation.  It is 
functionally equivalent to the look back algorithms, without looking back. 
It can be used for graphic stereograms, as well as the text stereograms. 
It simply stores in PATTERN the values we would look back at.  The input 
file is depth data, or a z-buffer (see example input below).  The levels 
available in a picture are the maximum pattern size divided by two minus 
one.  Maximum pattern size should be equivalent to half the distance 
between the eyes (for easy viewing), which is about 1 1/4 inches.  So, for 
typical text stereograms on an 80 char display, that's about 10 characters 
for the maximum pattern size and 4 or 5 levels available.  However, since 
4 or 5 levels is unreasonable, we push the max pattern size to 16 (still 
less that the 20 character distance between the eyes).  This gives us about 
7 or 8 levels.

If we do allow more than 7 levels when the max pattern size is 16, the 
repeating pattern (of size max pattern - current level) grows so small that 
four of them in a row (e.g., of size 7) would also create two double 
patterns in a row (of size 14), causing floaties (aliasing).  

I hope I'm making some sense.  I'll try to spend some time rewriting this. 
In addition, I'll integrate answers to any questions that come as a result 
of this mess!  In addition to the information here, we need to add a good 
description of how they work (that is not covered here).


PL : Previous Level value
NL : Next Level value

INITIAL LEVEL SETTING
PL = 0

OPEN INPUT FILE FOR READING
WHILE NOT EOF (Y DIMENSION: FOR EACH LINE)

   GENERATE NEW PATTERN
   SET PATTERN PTR TO BEGINNING OF PATTERN
   OUTPUT FULL PATTERN

   WHILE NOT EOL (X DIMENSION: FOR EACH POSITION)

      NL = NEXT INPUT LEVEL VALUE
      IF NL != PL (IF WE'RE CHANGING LEVELS)

         IF NL > PL (IF WE'RE MOVING UP)
            DELETE NEXT NL-PL BITS IN PATTERN FROM PTR FORWARD
            (IF GOING FROM LEVEL 0 TO 2, DELETE 2 BITS IN PATTERN)

         ELSE (IF MOVING DOWN, AWAY)
            INSERT PL-NL RANDOM BITS INTO PATTERN AT PTR POSITION
            (IF GOING FROM LEVEL 3 TO 2, INSERT 1 BIT INTO PATTERN)

         PL = NL (UPDATE PL)
         OUTPUT NEXT VALUE IN PATTERN

      ELSE
         OUTPUT NEXT VALUE IN PATTERN

      ADVANCE PATTERN PTR (CIRCULAR PATTERN)
      ADVANCE INPUT PTR
            

(Redundancy exists to simplify readability.)

Assuming spaces translate to level 0, input like this (thanks, Dave 
Thomas):

This uses 16 as the Max pattern size.  Notice on the third line of the 
output (the first line with level changes), the pattern is "7Z ... &{:".
When we go from level 0 to level 2, we lose two characters (i.e., ":.").
When we go from level 2 back to level 0, we insert two new characters 
(i.e., "05" after the "osw5").

Any questions?  Or better yet, what did I leave out??  I do hope this helps 
someone!?!

----- C CODE TO GENERATE TEXT STEREOGRAMS -----------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Also from Dave Thomas:

Now here's a hack of a hack I found on the net.  Basically it generates
stereograms from ascii diagrams.  Here's the program first:

#define DEPTH0  16
#define COLS    79

#include <stdio.h>

main()
   {
   long now;
   int col;
   char m[COLS+1],s[COLS+1];
   int i,e,c;

   /* seed random number generator */
   time (&now);
   srand (now);

   /* print fusion X's */
   for (col = 0; COLS - col >= DEPTH0; col += DEPTH0)
      {
      for (i = 0; i < DEPTH0-1; ++i)
         putchar (' ');
      putchar ('X');
      }
   putchar ('\n');

   /* process input image */
   while (memset(m,'\0',COLS+1),fgets (m, COLS+1, stdin))
      {
      e = 0;
      s[COLS] = 0;
      for(i=0; i<COLS; )
         {
         e = 0;
         while (i >= DEPTH0 && i < COLS && 
            (c = m[i - DEPTH0]) >= '0' && c <= '9')
            {
            e = 1;

----- HOPE FOR THE HOPELESS :-) ---------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

From: wchaga@vela.acs.oakland.edu (William C. Haga)

Being one who has used wide-eyed vision on chain link fences ever
since I was a kid, I was able to see the images in SIRDS right
away. But I've had difficulty explaining the technique to 
friends. Today I had the latest Games magazine with me at my parents
house. Games is running another contest using SIRDS, so there are
three in the latest issue. This time I thought of the reflection
idea. So I opened mom's china cabinet, put the magazine against the
glass in the door, and told mom to keep looking at her own reflection
in the glass until the image appeared.

It took less than thirty seconds.

When she saw the 3d train engines, I was subjected to a squeal of
delight that I hadn't heard from her for a long time. "EEK! IT'S
COMING OUT AT ME! IS THIS EVER NEAT!".  Dad tried for about a minute
but gave up.

About an hour later, mom and I heard a shout. We went to
the dining area, and there was dad with the magazine against the
glass in the door. "Isn't that just the most amazing thing!", said he.

Later they were making jokes about teaching old dogs new tricks.

----- COMMERCIAL SIRDS Posters ----------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

From: thale@novell.com (Todd D. Hale)

For those who do not have a local SIRDS distributor (i.e., the poster
cart at the mall), here is one company you can order them from.  The 
following posters are all certifiably cool with lots of great details,
and come in nice colors.  They are (I believe) designed by NVision, or 
something like that, and distributed here by Axis Corp.

Posters:$25 Dinosaurs
        $25 Discovery (Space shuttle and planet)
        $25 Lady Liberty (U.S. Statue of Liberty)
        $25 B-2 Stealth Bomber
        $25 F-117 Bomber
        $25 Nature's Majesty (Eagle with fish in talons, pine trees in bkgrd)
        $30 Calypso Reef (Ocean Scene--new design, more detail)
        Many more now, including small, $15 posters.

Address:Axis Corp.
        1732 S. 790 W.
        Salt Lake City, UT 84104
        USA
Phone:  (801)977-8816

You must include $5 for shipping and a poster tube.  (The guy quoted me
that price for shipping to Australia.)  Or, you can pay $17 for a tube
in a box.  Although they haven't had any problems shipping in the poster
tubes, they only guarantee safe delivery in a well-packed box.

Since I'm writing from the U.S., all currency mentioned here is in U.S.
dollars.

And, by no means am I associated with these guys at all, except I spend a
lot of time enjoying their posters!  (i.e., this is not an ad, but a 
response to a request for SIRDS access.)
