Introduction

   This FAQ is posted monthly to sci.fractals, a Usenet newsgroup about
   fractals; mathematics and software. This document is aimed at being a
   reference about fractals, including answers to commonly asked
   questions, archive listings of fractal software, images, and papers
   that can be accessed via the Internet using FTP, gopher, or
   World-Wide-Web (WWW), and a bibliography for further readings.
   
   The FAQ does not give a textbook approach to learning about fractals,
   but a summary of information from which you can learn more about and
   explore fractals.
   
   This FAQ is posted monthly to the Usenet newsgroups: sci.fractals
   ("Objects of non-integral dimension and other chaos"), sci.answers,
   and news.answers. Like most FAQs it can be obtained freely with a WWW
   browser (such as Mosaic or Netscape), or by anonymous FTP from
   ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/sci/fractals-faq (USA). It
   is also available from
   ftp://ftp.Germany.EU.net/pub/newsarchive/news.answers/sci/fractals-faq
   .gz (Europe),

  Suggestions, Comments, Mistakes
  
   Please send suggestions and corrections about the sci.fractals FAQ to
   fractal-faq@mta.ca. Without your contributions, the FAQ for
   sci.fractals will not grow in its wealth. "For the readers, by the
   readers." Rather than calling me a fool behind my back, if you find a
   mistake, whether spelling or factual, please send me a note. That way
   readers of future versions of the FAQ will not be misled. Also if you
   have problems with the appearance of the hypertext version. There
   should not be any Netscape only markup tags contained in the hypertext
   verion, but I have not followed strict HTML 3.2 specifications. If the
   appearance is "incorrect" let me know what problems you experience.
   
  Why the different name?
  
   The old Fractal FAQ about fractals has not been updated for over two
   years and has not been posted by Dr. Ermel Stepp, in as long. So this
   is a new FAQ based on the previous FAQ's information and the readers
   of primarily sci.fractals, and FRAC-L. Thus it is now called the
   sci.fractals FAQ.

   There are a couple of common mistakes people make, posting ads,
   posting large binaries (images or programs), and posting off-topic.
   
   Do Not Post Images to sci.fractals. If you follow this rule people
   will be your friend. There is a special place for you to post your
   images, alt.binaries.pictures.fractals. The other group
   (alt.fractals.pictures) is considered obsolete and may not be carried
   to as many people as alt.binaries.pictures.fractals. In fact there is
   CancelBot which will delete any posts it finds in sci.fractals (and
   most other non-binaries newsgroup) so nearly no one will see it.
   
   Post only about fractals, this includes fractal mathematics, software
   to generate fractals, where to get fractal posters and T-shirts, and
   fractals as art. Do not bother posting about news events not directly
   related to fractals, or about which OS / hardware / language is
   better. These lead to flame wars.
   
   Do not post advertisements. I should not have to mention this, but
   people do stupid things. If you have some fractal software (or
   posters) available is shareware or shrink-wrap commerical, post your
   brief announcement once. After than, you should limit yourself to
   notices of upgrades and responding via e-mail to people looking for
   fractal software.

Subject: Learning about fractals

   Q1: I want to learn about fractals. What should I read/view first?
   
   A1: Chaos: Makeing a New Science, by James Gleick, is a good book to
   get a general overview and history that does not require an extensive
   math background. Fractals Everywhere, by Michael Barnsley, and Measure
   Topology and Fractal Geometry, by G. A. Edgar, are textbooks that
   describe mathematically what fractals are and how to generate them,
   but they requires a college level mathematics background. Chaos,
   Fractals, and Dynamics, by R. L. Devaney, is also a good start. There
   is a longer book list at the end of the FAQ (see "What are some
   general references?").
   
   Also, there are networked resources available, such as :

Subject: What is a fractal?

   Q2: What is a fractal? What are some examples of fractals?
   
   A2: A fractal is a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be
   subdivided in parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a
   reduced-size copy of the whole. Fractals are generally self-similar
   and independent of scale.
   
   There are many mathematical structures that are fractals; e.g.
   Sierpinski triangle, Koch snowflake, Peano curve, Mandelbrot set, and
   Lorenz attractor. Fractals also describe many real-world objects, such
   as clouds, mountains, turbulence, coastlines, roots, branches of
   trees, blood vesels, and lungs of animals, that do not correspond to
   simple geometric shapes.
   
   Benoit B. Mandelbrot gives a mathematical definition of a fractal as a
   set of which the Hausdorff Besicovich dimension strictly exceeds the
   topological dimension. However, he is not satisfied with this
   definition as it excludes sets one would consider fractals.
   
   According to Mandelbrot, who invented the word: "I coined fractal from
   the Latin adjective fractus. The corresponding Latin verb frangere
   means "to break:" to create irregular fragments. It is therefore
   sensible - and how appropriate for our needs! - that, in addition to
   "fragmented" (as in fraction or refraction), fractus should also mean
   "irregular," both meanings being preserved in fragment." (The Fractal
   Geometry of Nature, page 4.)

Subject: Chaos

   Q3a: What is chaos?
   
   A3a: Chaos is apparently unpredictable behavior arising in a
   deterministic system because of great sensitivity to initial
   conditions. Chaos arises in a dynamical system if two arbitrarily
   close starting points diverge exponentially, so that their future
   behavior is eventually unpredictable.
   
   Weather is considered chaotic since arbitrarily small variations in
   initial conditions can result in radically different weather later.
   This may limit the possibilities of long-term weather forecasting.
   (The canonical example is the possibility of a butterfly's sneeze
   affecting the weather enough to cause a hurricane weeks later.)
   
   Devaney defines a function as chaotic if it has sensitive dependence
   on initial conditions, it is topologically transitive, and periodic
   points are dense. In other words, it is unpredictable, indecomposable,
   and yet contains regularity.
   
   Allgood and Yorke define chaos as a trajectory that is exponentially
   unstable and neither periodic or asymptotically periodic. That is, it
   oscillates irregularly without settling down.
   
   sci.fractals may not be the best place for chaos/non-linear dynamics
   questions, sci.nonlinear newsgroup should be much better.
   
   Q3b: Are fractals and chaos synonymous ?
   
   A3b: No. Many people do confuse the two domains because books or
   papers about chaos speak of the two concepts or are illustrated with
   fractals.
   Fractals and deterministic chaos are mathematical tools to modelise
   different kinds of natural phenomena or objects. The keywords in chaos
   are impredictability, sensitivity to initial conditions in spite of
   the deterministic set of equations describing the phenomenon.
   
   On the other hand, the keywords to fractals are self-similarity,
   invariance of scale. Many fractals are in no way chaotic (Sirpinski
   triangle, Koch curve...).
   
   However, starting from very differents point of view, the two domains
   have many things in common : many chaotic phenomena exhibit fractals
   structures (in their strange attractors for example... fractal
   structure is also obvious in chaotics phenomena due to successive
   bifurcations ; see for example the logistic equation Q9 )
   
   The following resources may be helpful to understand chaos:

Subject: Fractal dimension

   Q4a : What is fractal dimension? How is it calculated?
   
   A4a: A common type of fractal dimension is the Hausdorff-Besicovich
   Dimension, but there are several different ways of computing fractal
   dimension.
   
   Roughly, fractal dimension can be calculated by taking the limit of
   the quotient of the log change in object size and the log change in
   measurement scale, as the measurement scale approaches zero. The
   differences come in what is exactly meant by "object size" and what is
   meant by "measurement scale" and how to get an average number out of
   many different parts of a geometrical object. Fractal dimensions
   quantify the static geometry of an object.
   
   For example, consider a straight line. Now blow up the line by a
   factor of two. The line is now twice as long as before. Log 2 / Log 2
   = 1, corresponding to dimension 1. Consider a square. Now blow up the
   square by a factor of two. The square is now 4 times as large as
   before (i.e. 4 original squares can be placed on the original square).
   Log 4 / log 2 = 2, corresponding to dimension 2 for the square.
   Consider a snowflake curve formed by repeatedly replacing ___ with
   _/\_, where each of the 4 new lines is 1/3 the length of the old line.
   Blowing up the snowflake curve by a factor of 3 results in a snowflake
   curve 4 times as large (one of the old snowflake curves can be placed
   on each of the 4 segments _/\_). Log 4 / log 3 = 1.261... Since the
   dimension 1.261 is larger than the dimension 1 of the lines making up
   the curve, the snowflake curve is a fractal.

   Q4b : What is topological dimension?
   
   A4b: Topological dimension is the "normal" idea of dimension; a point
   has topological dimension 0, a line has topological dimension 1, a
   surface has topological dimension 2, etc.
   
   For a rigorous definition:
   A set has topological dimension 0 if every point has arbitrarily small
   neighborhoods whose boundaries do not intersect the set.
   
   A set S has topological dimension k if each point in S has arbitrarily
   small neighborhoods whose boundaries meet S in a set of dimension k-1,
   and k is the least nonnegative integer for which this holds.

Subject: Strange attractors

   Q5: What is a strange attractor?
   
   A5: A strange attractor is the limit set of a chaotic trajectory. A
   strange attractor is an attractor that is topologically distinct from
   a periodic orbit or a limit cycle. A strange attractor can be
   considered a fractal attractor. An example of a strange attractor is
   the Henon attractor.

   a system may have. For a dissipative system, this volume will shrink
   as the system evolves in time (Liouville's Theorem). If the system is
   sensitive to initial conditions, the trajectories of the points
   defining initial conditions will move apart in some directions, closer
   in others, but there will be a net shrinkage in volume. Ultimately,
   all points will lie along a fine line of zero volume. This is the
   strange attractor. All initial points in phase space which ultimately
   land on the attractor form a Basin of Attraction. A strange attractor
   results if a system is sensitive to initial conditions and is not
   conservative.
   
   Note: While all chaotic attractors are strange, not all strange
   attractors are chaotic.

Subject: The Mandelbrot set

   Q6a : What is the Mandelbrot set?
   
   A6a: The Mandelbrot set is the set of all complex c such that
   iterating z -> z^2 + c does not go to infinity (starting with z = 0).

   Q6b : How is the Mandelbrot set actually computed?
   
   A6b: The basic algorithm is: For each pixel c, start with z = 0.
   Repeat z = z^2 + c up to N times, exiting if the magnitude of z gets
   large. If you finish the loop, the point is probably inside the
   Mandelbrot set. If you exit, the point is outside and can be colored
   according to how many iterations were completed. You can exit if
   |z| > 2, since if z gets this big it will go to infinity. The maximum
   number of iterations, N, can be selected as desired, for instance 100.
   Larger N will give sharper detail but take longer.
   
   Frode Gill has some information about generating the Mandelbrot Set at
   http://www.krs.hia.no/~fgill/mandel.html.
   
   Q6c : Why do you start with z = 0?
   
   A6c: Zero is the critical point of z = z^2 + c, that is, a point where
   d/dz (z^2 + c) = 0. If you replace z^2 + c with a different function,
   the starting value will have to be modified. E.g. for z -> z^2 +  z,
   the critical point is given by 2z + 1 = 0, so start with z = -0.5. In
   some cases, there may be multiple critical values, so they all should
   be tested.
   
   Critical points are important because by a result of Fatou: every
   attracting cycle for a polynomial or rational function attracts at
   least one critical point. Thus, testing the critical point shows if
   there is any stable attractive cycle. See also:

       Role of Critical Points, Computers and Graphics 16, 1 (1992), pp.
       35-40.
       
   Note that you can precompute the first Mandelbrot iteration by
   starting with z = c instead of z = 0, since 02 + c = c.
   
   Q6d: What are the bounds of the Mandelbrot set? When does it diverge?
   
   A6d: The Mandelbrot set lies within |c| <= 2. If |z| exceeds 2, the z
   sequence diverges.
   Proof: if |z| > 2, then |z^2 + c| >= |z^2| - |c| > 2|z| - |c|. If
   |z| >= |c|, then 2|z| - |c| > |z|. So, if |z| > 2 and |z| >= c, then
   |z^2 + c| > |z|, so the sequence is increasing. (It takes a bit more
   work to prove it is unbounded and diverges.) Also, note that |z| = c,
   so if |c| > 2, the sequence diverges.
   
   Q6e : How can I speed up Mandelbrot set generation?
   
   A6e: See the information on speed below (see "Fractint"). Also see:

       of the Mandelbrot Set, Computers and Graphics 15, 1 (1991), pp.
       91-100.
       
   Q6f: What is the area of the Mandelbrot set?
   
   A6f: Ewing and Schober computed an area estimate using 240,000 terms
   of the Laurent series. The result is 1.7274... However, the Laurent
   series converges very slowly, so this is a poor estimate. A project to
   measure the area via counting pixels on a very dense grid shows an
   area around 1.5066. (Contact rpm%mrob.uucp@spdcc.com for more
   information.) Hill and Fisher used distance estimation techniques to
   rigorously bound the area and found the area is between 1.503 and
   1.5701. Jay Hill's latest results using Root Solving and Component
   Series Evaluation shows the area is at least 1.506302 and less than
   1.5613027. See Fractal Horizons edited by Cliff Pickover and Hill's
   home page for details about his work.

   Q6g: What can you say about the structure of the Mandelbrot set?
   
   A6g: Most of what you could want to know is in Branner's article in
   Chaos and Fractals: The Mathematics Behind the Computer Graphics.
   
   Note that the Mandelbrot set in general is not strictly self-similar;
   the tiny copies of the Mandelbrot set are all slightly different,
   mainly because of the thin threads connecting them to the main body of
   the Mandelbrot set. However, the Mandelbrot set is quasi-self-similar.
   However, the Mandelbrot set is self-similar under magnification in
   neighborhoods of Misiurewicz points (e.g. -.1011 + .9563i). The
   Mandelbrot set is conjectured to be self-similar around generalized
   Feigenbaum points (e.g. -1.401155 or -.1528 + 1.0397i), in the sense
   of converging to a limit set.

   The "external angles" of the Mandelbrot set (see Douady and Hubbard or

   onto it.
   
   The boundary of the Mandelbrot set and the Julia set of a generic c in
   M have Hausdorff dimension 2 and have topological dimension 1. The
   proof is based on the study of the bifurcation of parabolic periodic
   points. (Since the boundary has empty interior, the topological
   dimension is less than 2, and thus is 1.)

   Q6h: Is the Mandelbrot set connected?
   
   A6h: The Mandelbrot set is simply connected. This follows from a
   theorem of Douady and Hubbard that there is a conformal isomorphism
   from the complement of the Mandelbrot set to the complement of the
   unit disk. (In other words, all equipotential curves are simple closed
   curves.) It is conjectured that the Mandelbrot set is locally
   connected, and thus pathwise connected, but this is currently
   unproved.
   
   Connectedness definitions:
   Connected: X is connected if there are no proper closed subsets A and
   B of X such that A union B = X, but A intersect B is empty. I.e. X is
   connected if it is a single piece.
   
   Simply connected: X is simply connected if it is connected and every
   closed curve in X can be deformed in X to some constant closed curve.
   I.e. X is simply connected if it has no holes.
   
   Locally connected: X is locally connected if for every point p in X,
   for every open set U containing p, there is an open set V containing p
   and contained in the connected component of p in U. I.e. X is locally
   connected if every connected component of every open subset is open in
   X. Arcwise (or path) connected: X is arcwise connected if every two
   points in X are joined by an arc in X.
   
   (The definitions are from Encyclopedic Dictionary of Mathematics.)

   Q6j: What is the dimension of the Mandelbrot Set?
   
   A6j: The Mandelbrot Set has a dimension of 2. The Mandelbrot Set
   contains and is contained in a disk. A disk has a dimension of 2, thus
   so does the Mandelbrot Set.
   
   The Koch snowflake (Hausdorff dimension 1.2619...) does not satisfy
   this condition because it is a thin boundary curve, thus containing no
   disk. If you add the region inside the curve then it does have
   dimension of 2.
   
   The boundary of the Mandelbrot set and the Julia set of a generic c in
   M have Hausdorff dimension 2 and have topological dimension 1. The
   proof is based on the study of the bifurcation of parabolic periodic
   points. (Since the boundary has empty interior, the topological
   dimension is less than 2, and thus is 1.) See reference above

Subject: Julia sets

   Q7a: What is the difference between the Mandelbrot set and a Julia
   set?
   
   A7a: The Mandelbrot set iterates z^2 + c with z starting at 0 and
   varying c. The Julia set iterates z^2 + c for fixed c and varying
   starting z values. That is, the Mandelbrot set is in parameter space
   (c-plane) while the Julia set is in dynamical or variable space
   (z-plane).
   
   Q7b: What is the connection between the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets?
   
   A7b: Each point c in the Mandelbrot set specifies the geometric
   structure of the corresponding Julia set. If c is in the Mandelbrot
   set, the Julia set will be connected. If c is not in the Mandelbrot
   set, the Julia set will be a Cantor dust.
   
   Q7c: How is a Julia set actually computed?
   
   A7c: The Julia set can be computed by iteration similar to the
   Mandelbrot computation. The only difference is that the c value is
   fixed and the initial z value varies.
   
   Alternatively, points on the boundary of the Julia set can be computed
   quickly by using inverse iterations. This technique is particularly
   useful when the Julia set is a Cantor Set. In inverse iteration, the
   equation z1 = z0^2 + c is reversed to give an equation for z0: z0 =
   ±sqrt(z1 - c). By applying this equation repeatedly, the resulting
   points quickly converge to the Julia set boundary. (At each step,
   either the positive or negative root is randomly selected.) This is a
   nonlinear iterated function system.
   
   In pseudocode:
   
 z = 1 (or any value)
loop
 if (random number < .5) then
  z = sqrt(z - c)
 else
  z = -sqrt(z - c)
 endif
 plot z
end loop

   Q7d: What are some Julia set facts?
   
   A7d: The Julia set of any rational map of degree greater than one is
   perfect (hence in particular uncountable and nonempty), completely
   invariant, equal to the Julia set of any iterate of the function, and
   also is the boundary of the basin of attraction of every attractor for
   the map.

Subject: Complex arithmetic and quaternion arithmetic

   Q8a: How does complex arithmetic work?
   
   A8a: It works mostly like regular algebra with a couple additional
   formulas:
   (note: a, b are reals, x, y are complex, i is the square root of -1)
   
   Powers of i:
          i^2 = -1
          
   Addition:
          (a+i*b)+(c+i*d) = (a+c)+i*(b+d)
          
   Multiplication:
          (a+i*b)*(c+i*d) = a*c-b*d + i*(a*d+b*c)
          
   Division:
          (a+i*b) / (c+i*d) = (a+i*b)*(c-i*d) / (c^2+d^2)
          
   Exponentiation:
          exp(a+i*b) = exp(a)*(cos(b)+i*sin(b))
          
   Sine:
          sin(x) = (exp(i*x) - exp(-i*x)) / (2*i)
          
   Cosine:
          cos(x) = (exp(i*x) + exp(-i*x)) / 2
          
   Magnitude:
          |a+i*b| = sqrt(a^2+b^2)
          
   Log:
          log(a+i*b) = log(|a+i*b|)+i*arctan(b / a) (Note: log is
          multivalued.)
          
   Log (polar coordinates):
          log(r e^(i*a)) = log(r)+i*a
          
   Complex powers:
          x^y = exp(y*log(x))
          
   de Moivre's theorem:
          x^n = r^n [cos(n*a) + i*sin(n*a)] (where n is an integer)
          
   More details can be found in any complex analysis book.
   
   Q8b: How does quaternion arithmetic work?
   
   A8b: quaternions have 4 components (a + ib + jc + kd) compared to the
   two of complex numbers. Operations such as addition and multiplication
   can be performed on quaternions, but multiplication is not
   commutative.
   
   Quaternions satisfy the rules
   
     * i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1
     * ij = -ji = k
     * jk = -kj = i,
     * ki = -ik = j

Subject: Logistic equation

   Q9: What is the logistic equation?
   
   A9: It models animal populations. The equation is x -> c x (1 - x),
   where x is the population (between 0 and 1) and c is a growth
   constant. Iteration of this equation yields the period doubling route
   to chaos. For c between 1 and 3, the population will settle to a fixed
   value. At 3, the period doubles to 2; one year the population is very
   high, causing a low population the next year, causing a high
   population the following year. At 3.45, the period doubles again to 4,
   meaning the population has a four year cycle. The period keeps
   doubling, faster and faster, at 3.54, 3.564, 3.569, and so forth. At
   3.57, chaos occurs; the population never settles to a fixed period.
   For most c values between 3.57 and 4, the population is chaotic, but
   there are also periodic regions. For any fixed period, there is some c
   value that will yield that period. See An Introduction to Chaotic
   Dynamical Systems, by R. L. Devaney, for more information.

Subject: Feigenbaum's constant

   Q10: What is Feigenbaum's constant?
   
   A10: In a period doubling cascade, such as the logistic equation,
   consider the parameter values where period-doubling events occur (e.g.
   r[1]=3, r[2]=3.45, r[3]=3.54, r[4]=3.564...). Look at the ratio of
   distances between consecutive doubling parameter values; let delta[n]
   = (r[n+1]-r[n])/(r[n+2]-r[n+1]). Then the limit as n goes to infinity
   is Feigenbaum's (delta) constant.
   
   Based on computations by F. Christiansen, P. Cvitanovic and H.H. Rugh,
   it has the value 4.6692016091029906718532038... Note: several books
   have published incorrect values starting 4.66920166...; the last
   repeated 6 is a typographical error.
   
   The interpretation of the delta constant is as you approach chaos,
   each periodic region is smaller than the previous by a factor
   approaching 4.669...
   
   Feigenbaum's constant is important because it is the same for any
   function or system that follows the period-doubling route to chaos and
   has a one-hump quadratic maximum. For cubic, quartic, etc. there are
   different Feigenbaum constants.
   
   Feigenbaum's alpha constant is not as well known; it has the value
   2.50290787509589282228390287272909. This constant is the scaling
   factor between x values at bifurcations. Feigenbaum says,
   "Asymptotically, the separation of adjacent elements of period-doubled
   attractors is reduced by a constant value [alpha] from one doubling to
   the next". If d[a] is the algebraic distance between nearest elements
   of the attractor cycle of period 2^a, then d[a]/d[a+1] converges to
   -alpha.

Subject: Iterated function systems and compression

   Q11a: What is an iterated function system (IFS)?
   
   A11a: If a fractal is self-similar, you can specify mappings that map
   the whole onto the parts. Iteration of these mappings will result in
   convergence to the fractal attractor. An IFS consists of a collection
   of these (usually affine) mappings. If a fractal can be described by a
   small number of mappings, the IFS is a very compact description of the
   fractal. An iterated function system is By taking a point and
   repeatedly applying these mappings you end up with a collection of
   points on the fractal. In other words, instead of a single mapping x
   -> F(x), there is a collection of (usually affine) mappings, and
   random selection chooses which mapping is used.
   
   For instance, the Sierpinski triangle can be decomposed into three
   self-similar subtriangles. The three contractive mappings from the
   full triangle onto the subtriangles forms an IFS. These mappings will
   be of the form "shrink by half and move to the top, left, or right".
   
   Iterated function systems can be used to make things such as fractal
   ferns and trees and are also used in fractal image compression.
   Fractals Everywhere by Barnsley is mostly about iterated function
   systems.
   
   The simplest algorithm to display an IFS is to pick a starting point,
   randomly select one of the mappings, apply it to generate a new point,
   plot the new point, and repeat with the new point. The displayed
   points will rapidly converge to the attractor of the IFS.

   Q11b: What is the state of fractal compression?
   
   A11b: Fractal compression is quite controversial, with some people
   claiming it doesn't work well, and others claiming it works
   wonderfully. The basic idea behind fractal image compression is to
   express the image as an iterated function system (IFS). The image can
   then be displayed quickly and zooming will generate infinite levels of
   (synthetic) fractal detail. The problem is how to efficiently generate
   the IFS from the image. Barnsley, who invented fractal image
   compression, has a patent on fractal compression techniques
   (4,941,193). Barnsley's company, Iterated Systems Inc
   (http://www.iterated.com/), has a line of products including a Windows
   viewer, compressor, magnifier program, and hardware assist board.

Subject: L-Systems

   Q13: What are L-systems?
   
   A13: A L-system or Lindenmayer system is a formal grammar for
   generating strings. (That is, it is a collection of rules such as
   replace X with XYX.) By recursively applying the rules of the L-system
   to an initial string, a string with fractal structure can be created.
   Interpreting this string as a set of graphical commands allows the
   fractal to be displayed. L-systems are very useful for generating
   realistic plant structures.
   
   Some references are:

       Plants, Springer-Verlag, NY, 1990. ISBN 0-387-97297-8. A very good

Subject: Fractal mountains

   Q15: How are fractal mountains generated?
   
   A15: Usually by a method such as taking a triangle, dividing it into 3
   sub-triangles, and perturbing the center point. This process is then
   repeated on the sub-triangles. This results in a 2-d table of heights,
   which can then be rendered as a 3-d image. This is referred to as
   midpoint displacement. Two references are:

   such as described in The Science of Fractal Images. Lucasfilm became
   famous for its fractal landscape sequences in Star Trek II: The Wrath

Subject: Lyapunov fractals

   Q17a: Where are the popular periodically-forced Lyapunov fractals
   described?
   
   A17a: See:
   
    1. A. K. Dewdney, Leaping into Lyapunov Space, Scientific American,
       Sept. 1991, pp. 178-180.

       Periodic Forcing, Computers and Graphics 13, 4 (1989), pp.
       553-558.
    3. M. Markus, Chaos in Maps with Continuous and Discontinuous Maxima,
       Computers in Physics, Sep/Oct 1990, pp. 481-493.
       
   Q17b: What are Lyapunov exponents?
   
   A17b: Lyapunov exponents quantify the amount of linear stability or
   instability of an attractor, or an asymptotically long orbit of a
   dynamical system. There are as many lyapunov exponents as there are
   dimensions in the state space of the system, but the largest is
   usually the most important.
   
   Given two initial conditions for a chaotic system, a and b, which are
   close together, the average values obtained in successive iterations
   for a and b will differ by an exponentially increasing amount. In
   other words, the two sets of numbers drift apart exponentially. If
   this is written e^(n*(lambda) for n iterations, then e^(lambda) is the
   factor by which the distance between closely related points becomes
   stretched or contracted in one iteration. Lambda is the Lyapunov
   exponent. At least one Lyapunov exponent must be positive in a chaotic
   system. A simple derivation is available in:
   
    1. H. G. Schuster, Deterministic Chaos: An Introduction, Physics
       Verlag, 1984.
       
   Q17c: How can Lyapunov exponents be calculated?
   
   A17c: For the common periodic forcing pictures, the lyapunov exponent
   is:
   
   lambda = limit as N -> infinity of 1/N times sum from n=1 to N of
   log2(abs(dx sub n+1 over dx sub n))
   
   In other words, at each point in the sequence, the derivative of the
   iterated equation is evaluated. The Lyapunov exponent is the average
   value of the log of the derivative. If the value is negative, the
   iteration is stable. Note that summing the logs corresponds to
   multiplying the derivatives; if the product of the derivatives has
   magnitude < 1, points will get pulled closer together as they go
   through the iteration.
   
   MS-DOS and Unix programs for estimating Lyapunov exponents from short
   time series are available by ftp: ftp://inls.ucsd.edu/pub/ncsu/
   
   Computing Lyapunov exponents in general is more difficult. Some

Subject: How can I take photos of fractals?

   Q19: How can I take photos of fractals?
   
   A19: Noel Giffin gets good results with the following setup: Use 100
   ISO (ASA) Kodak Gold for prints or 64 ISO (ASA) for slides. Use a long
   lens (100mm) to flatten out the field of view and minimize screen
   curvature. Use f/4 stop. Shutter speed must be longer than frame rate
   to get a complete image; 1/4 seconds works well. Use a tripod and
   cable release or timer to get a stable picture. The room should be
   completely blackened, with no light, to prevent glare and to prevent
   the monitor from showing up in the picture.
   
   You can also obtain high quality images by sending your Targa or GIF
   images to a commercial graphics imaging shop. They can provide much
   higher resolution images. Prices are about $10 for a 35mm slide or
   negative and about $50 for a high quality 4x5 negative.

Subject: 3-D fractals

   Q21: How can 3-D fractals be generated?
   
   A21: A common source for 3-D fractals is to compute Julia sets with
   quaternions instead of complex numbers. The resulting Julia set is
   four dimensional. By taking a slice through the 4-D Julia set (e.g. by
   fixing one of the coordinates), a 3-D object is obtained. This object
   can then be displayed using computer graphics techniques such as ray
   tracing.

       Graphics and Imaging.
       
   Instead of quaternions, you can of course use hypercomplex number such
   as in "FractInt", or other functions. For instance, you could use a
   map with more than one parameter, which would generate a
   higher-dimensional fractal.
   
   Another way of generating 3-D fractals is to use 3-D iterated function
   systems (IFS). These are analogous to 2-D IFS, except they generate
   points in a 3-D space.
   
   A third way of generating 3-D fractals is to take a 2-D fractal such
   as the Mandelbrot set, and convert the pixel values to heights to
   generate a 3-D "Mandelbrot mountain". This 3-D object can then be
   rendered with normal computer graphics techniques.
   
   POV-Ray 3.0, a freely available ray tracing package, has added 4-D
   fractal support. It takes a 3-D slice of a 4-D Julia set based on an
   arbitrary 3-D "plane" done at any angle. For more information see the
   POV Ray web site at http://www.povray.org/ .

  Macintosh
  
   There is NO Macintosh version of Fractint, although there may be
   several people working on a port. It is possibleto run Fractint on the
   Macintosh if you use Insignia Software's SoftAT, which is a PC AT
   emulator.

   Q22b: How does Fractint achieve its speed?
   
   A22b: Fractint's speed (such as it is) is due to a combination of:
   
    1. Using fixed point math rather than floating point where possible
       (huge improvement for non-coprocessor machine, small for 486's).
    2. Exploiting symmetry of the fractal.
    3. Detecting nearly repeating orbits, avoid useless iteration (e.g.
       repeatedly iterating 02+0 etc. etc.).
    4. Reducing computation by guessing solid areas (especially the
       "lake" area).
    5. Using hand-coded assembler in many places.
    6. Obtaining both sin and cos from one 387 math coprocessor
       instruction.
    7. Using good direct memory graphics writing in 256-color modes.
       
   The first four are probably the most important. Some of these
   introduce errors, usually quite acceptable.

Subject: FTP questions

   Q24a: How does anonymous ftp work?
   
   A24a: Anonymous ftp is a method of making files available to anyone on
   the Internet. In brief, if you are on a system with ftp (e.g. Unix),
   you type "ftp fractal.mta.ca", or whatever system you wish to access.
   You are prompted for your name and you reply "anonymous". You are
   prompted for your password and you reply with your email address. You
   then use "ls" to list the files, "cd" to change directories, "get" to
   get files, an "quit" to exit. For example, you could say "cd /pub",
   "ls", "get README", and "quit"; this would get you the file "README".
   See the man page ftp(1) or ask someone at your site for more
   information.
   
   In this FAQ, anonymous ftp addresses are given in the URL form
   ftp://name.of.machine/pub/path [138.73.1.18]. The first part is the
   protocol, FTP, rather than say "gopher", the second part
   "name.of.machine" is the machine you must ftp to. If your machine
   cannot determine the host from the name, you can try the numeric
   Internet address: "ftp 138.73.1.18". The part after the name:
   "/pub/path" is the file or directory to access once you are connected
   to the remote machine.
   
   Q24b: What if I can't use ftp to access files?
   
   A24b: If you don't have access to ftp because you are on a UUCP,
   Fidonet, BITNET network there is an e-mail gateway at
   ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com that can retrieve the files for you. To get
   instructions on how to use the ftp gateway send a message to
   ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com with one line containing the word "help".
   
   Warning, these archives can be very large, sometimes several megabytes
   (MB) of data which will be sent to your e-mail address. If you have a
   disk quota for incoming mail, often 1MB or less, be careful not exceed
   it.

Subject: Archived pictures

   Q25a: Where are fractal pictures archived?
   
  News groups
  
   A25a: Fractal images (GIFs, etc.) used to be posted to
   alt.fractals.pictures ; this newsgroup has been replaced by
   alt.binaries.pictures.fractals (known as abpf). However, several
   alt.binaries.pictures groups been badly reputed, alt.fractals.pictures

   Q25b: How do I view fractal pictures from
   alt.binaries.pictures.fractals?
   
   A25b: A detailed explanation is given in the "alt.binaries.pictures
   FAQ" (see "pictures-FAQ"). This is posted to the pictures newsgroups
   and is available by ftp:
   ftp://rtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/
   [18.181.0.24].
   
   In brief, there is a series of things you have to do before viewing
   these posted images. It will depend a little on the system your
   working with, but there is much in common. Some newsreaders have
   features to automatically extract and decode images ready to display
   ("e" in trn) but if you don't you can use the following manual method:
   
    1. Save/append all posted parts sequentially to one file.
    2. Edit this file and delete all text segments except what is between
       the BEGIN-CUT and END-CUT portions. This means that BEGIN-CUT and
       END-CUT lines will disappear as well. There will be a section to
       remove for each file segment as well as the final END-CUT line.
       What is left in the file after editing will be bizarre garbage
       starting with begin 660 imagename.GIF and then about 6000 lines
       all starting with the letter "M" followed by a final "end" line.
       This is called a uuencoded file.
    3. You must uudecode the uuencoded file. There should be an
       appropriate utility at your site; "uudecode filename " should work
       under Unix. Ask a system person or knowledgeable programming type.
       It will decode the file and produce another file called
       imagename.GIF. This is the image file.
    4. You must use another utility to view these GIF images. It must be
       capable of displaying color graphic images in GIF format. (If you
       get a JPG or JPEG format file, you may have to convert it to a GIF
       file with yet another utility.) In the XWindows environment, you
       may be able to use "xv", "xview", or "xloadimage" to view GIF
       files. If you aren't using X, then you'll either have to find a
       comparable utility for your system or transfer your file to some
       other system. You can use a file transfer utility such as Kermit
       to transfer the binary file to an IBM-PC.
       
   If you use a web browser such as Netscape to read
   alt.binaries.pictures.fractals, then it will automate the decoding for
   you. This is not be true of all web browsers.

   Q26: Where can I obtain papers about fractals?
   
   A26: There are several Internet sites with fractal papers: There is an
   ftp archive site for preprints and programs on nonlinear dynamics and
   related subjects at: ftp://inls.ucsd.edu/pub.
   
   There are also articles on dynamics, including the IMS preprint
   series, available from ftp://math.sunysb.edu/preprints.
   
   The WWW site http://inls.ucsd.edu/y/Complex/ has some fractal papers.
   
   The site life.csu.edu.au has a collection of fractal programs, papers,
   information related to complex systems, and gopher and World Wide Web
   connections.
   
   The ftp path is:
          ftp://life.csu.edu.au/pub/complex/ (Look in fractals, tutorial,
          and anu92)

   for discourse and collaboration on fractals, chaos, and complexity in
   multiple disciplines, professions, and arts.
   
   To subscribe to frac-l an email message to
   listproc@archives.math.utk.edu containing the sole line of text:
   SUBSCRIBE FRAC-L Your_first_name Your_last_name
   (substituting your actual first and last names, of course).
   
   To unsubscribe from frac-l, send LISTPROC (NOT frac-l) the message:
   UNSUBSCRIBE FRAC-L
   
   Messages may be posted to frac-l by sending email to:

  The Fractal-Art Discussion List
  
   This mailing list is open to all individuals and organizations
   interested in all aspects of Fractal Art. This would include fractal
   and digital artists, fractal software developers, gallery owners,
   museum curators, art marketers and brokers, printers, art collectors,

   authors explain the workings of the Fractal Transform(tm). The Fractal
   Transform is the compression tool for storing high-quality images in a
   minimal amount of space on a computer. Barnsley uses examples and
   algorithms to explain how to transform a stored pixel image into its
   fractal representation.

Multifractals

   Q30: What are multifractals?
   
   A30: It is not easy to give a succinct definition of multifractals.
   Following Feder (1988) one may distinguish a measure (of probability,
   or some physical quantity) from its geometric support - which might or
   might not have fractal geometry. Then if the measure has different
   fractal dimension on different parts of the support, the measure is a
   multifractal.
   
   Hastings and Sugihara (1993) distinguish multifractals from
   multiscaling fractals - which have different fractal dimensions at
   different scales (e.g. show a break in slope in a dividers plot, or
   some other power law). I believe different authors use different names
   for this phenomenon, which is often confused with true multifractal
   behaviour.

   NOTICE from J. C. (Clint) Sprott <SPROTT@juno.physics.wisc.edu>:
   
   The program, Chaos Data Analyzer, which I authored is a research and
   teaching tool containing 14 tests for detecting hidden determinism in
   a seemingly random time series of up to 16,382 points provided by the
   user in an ASCII data file. Sample data files are included for model
   chaotic systems. When chaos is found, calculations such as the
   probability distribution, power spectrum, Lyapunov exponent, and
   various measures of the fractal dimension enable you to determine
   properties of the system Underlying the behavior. The program can be
   used to make nonlinear predictions based on a novel technique
   involving singular value decomposition. The program is menu-driven,
   very easy to use, and even contains an automatic mode in which all the
   tests are performed in succession and the results are provided on a
   one-page summary.
   
   Chaos Data Analyzer requires an IBM PC or compatible with at least
   512K of memory. A math coprocessor is recommended (but not required)
   to speed some of the calculations. The program is available on 5.25 or
   3.5" disk and includes a 62-page User's Manual. Chaos Data Analyzer is
   peer-reviewed software published by Physics Academic Software, a
   cooperative Project of the American Institute of Physics, the American
   Physical Society, And the American Association of Physics Teachers.

   From Clifford Pickover <cliff@watson.ibm.com>
   
   You are cordially invited to submit interesting, well-written articles
   for the "Chaos and Graphics Section" of the international journal
   Computers and Graphics. I edit this on-going section which appears in
   each issue of the journal. Topics include the mathematical,
   scientific, and artistic application of fractals, chaos, and related.
   Your papers can be quite short if desired, for example, often a page
   or two is sufficient to convey an idea and a pretty graphic. Longer,
   technical papers are also welcome. The journal is peer-reviewed. I
   publish color, where appropriate. Write to me for guidelines. Novelty
   of images is often helpful.
   
  Goals
  
   The goal of my section is to provide visual demonstrations of
   complicated and beautiful structures which can arise in systems based
   on simple rules. The section presents papers on the seemingly
   paradoxical combinations of randomness and structure in systems of
   mathematical, physical, biological, electrical, chemical, and artistic
   interest. Topics include: iteration, cellular automata, bifurcation
   maps, fractals, dynamical systems, patterns of nature created from
   simple rules, and aesthetic graphics drawn from the universe of
   mathematics and art.
