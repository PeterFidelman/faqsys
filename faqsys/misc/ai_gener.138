*** Introduction:

Certain questions and topics come up frequently in the various network
discussion groups devoted to and related to Artificial Intelligence
(AI).  This file/article is an attempt to gather these questions and
their answers into a convenient reference for AI researchers. It is
posted on a monthly basis. The hope is that this will cut down on the
user time and network bandwidth used to post, read and respond to the
same questions over and over, as well as providing education by
answering questions some readers may not even have thought to ask.

The latest version of this FAQ is available via anonymous FTP from 
   ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/pubs/faqs/ai/  [128.2.206.173]
using username "anonymous" and password "name@host" (substitute your
email address) or via AFS in the Andrew File System directory
   /afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/pubs/faqs/ai/
as the files ai_1.faq, ai_2.faq, ai_3.faq, ai_4.faq, ai_5.faq and ai_6.faq.

Subject: [1-0] What is the purpose of this newsgroup?

The newsgroup comp.ai exists for general discussion of topics related
to Artificial Intelligence. For example, possible topics can
include (but are not necessarily limited to):
   announcements of AI books and products
   discussion of AI programs and tools
   questions about AI techniques
   problems implementing an AI technique
Postings should be of general interest to the AI community. See also
part 2 of the FAQ for a list of other more specialized discussion lists.

Every so often, somebody posts an inflammatory message, such as
   Will computers every really think?
   AI hasn't done anything worthwhile.
These "religious" issues serve no real purpose other than to waste
bandwidth. If you feel the urge to respond to such a post, please do
so through a private e-mail message, or post redirecting follow-ups to
comp.ai.philosophy.  

We've tried to minimize the overlap with the FAQ postings to the
comp.lang.lisp, comp.lang.prolog, comp.ai.neural-nets, and
comp.ai.shells newsgroups, so if you don't find what you're looking
for here, we suggest you try the FAQs for those newsgroups. These FAQs
should be available by anonymous ftp in subdirectories of
   rtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet/
or by sending a mail message to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with subject "help".

The Lisp FAQ is also available by anonymous ftp from the same ftp
location as the AI FAQ and from ftp.think.com:/public/think/lisp/.
The Expert Systems Shells FAQ is also available by anonymous ftp from
the same ftp location as the AI FAQ. 

Information about Prolog may be obtained from two sources: The Prolog
FAQ, which is posted twice a month to the newsgroup comp.lang.prolog
by Jamie Andrews <jamie@cs.sfu.ca>, and the Prolog Resource Guide,
which is posted to the newsgroup comp.lang.prolog once a month, and is
available by anonymous FTP from 
   ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/pubs/faqs/prolog/ [128.2.206.173] 
or in the AFS directory 
   /afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/pubs/faqs/prolog/
as the files prg_1.faq and prg_2.faq.

The Robotics FAQ is available by anonymous ftp from 
   ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/nivek/robotics-faq/ [128.2.206.173]
as the files part1 and part2. To obtain a copy by email, send a message to 
mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu containing the following lines:
   send usenet/news.answers/robotics-faq/part1
   send usenet/news.answers/robotics-faq/part2
On UUCP, it is available at 
   uunet!/archive/usenet/news.answers/robotics-faq/ 
as the files part1.Z and part2.Z, or by ftp from 
   ftp.uu.net:/archive/usenet/news.answers/robotics-faq/ [137.39.1.9]

Information about object-oriented programming can be obtained in the
newsgroups comp.object, comp.lang.clos, and comp.lang.smalltalk.
Information about object-oriented databases can be obtained in the
survey compiled by Stewart Clamen, which may be found either in the
comp.object FAQ posting, by anonymous FTP from
   ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/afs/cs/user/clamen/OODBMS/evolution-summary.gz
or at the URL
   http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~clamen/OODBMS/evolution-summary.gz

Subject: [1-2] Glossary of AI terms.

This is the start of a simple glossary of short definitions for AI terminology.

   ai:
        A three-toed sloth of genus Bradypus. This forest-dwelling
        animal eats the leaves of the trumpet-tree and sounds a
        high-pitched squeal when disturbed. (Based on the Random House
        dictionary definition.)

   Admissibility:
        An admissible search algorithm is one that is guaranteed to
        find an optimal path from the start node to a goal node, if
        one exists. In A* search, an admissible heuristic is one that never
        overestimates the distance remaining from the current node to
        the goal. 

   Case-based Reasoning: 
        Technique whereby "cases" similar to the current problem are
        retrieved and their "solutions" modified to work on the current
        problem. 

   Data Mining:
	Also known as Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) was been defined
	as "The nontrivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown, and
	potentially useful information from data" in Frawley and
	Piatetsky-Shapiro's overview.  It uses machine learning, statistical
	and visualization techniques to discover and present knowledge in a
	form which is easily comprehensible to humans.

   Fuzzy Logic:
        In Fuzzy Logic, truth values are real values in the closed
        interval [0..1]. The definitions of the boolean operators are
        extended to fit this continuous domain. By avoiding discrete
        truth-values, Fuzzy Logic avoids some of the problems inherent in
        either-or judgments and yields natural interpretations of utterances
        like "very hot". Fuzzy Logic has applications in control theory.

   Nonlinear Planning:
        A planning paradigm which does not enforce a total (linear)
        ordering on the components of a plan.

   Strong AI:           
        Claim that computers can be made to actually think, just like human
        beings do. More precisely, the claim that there exists a class of
        computer programs, such that any implementation of such a program is
        really thinking.

   Validation:
        The process of confirming that one's model uses measureable inputs
        and produces output that can be used to make decisions about the
        real world.

   Verification:
        The process of confirming that an implemented model works as intended.

   Weak AI:             
        Claim that computers are important tools in the modeling and
        simulation of human activity.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-3] What are the top schools in AI?

The answer to this question is not intended to be a ranking and should
not be interpreted as such. There are several major problems with
ratings like the Gourman Report and the US News and World Report. Such
rankings are often unsubstantiated and anecdotal, their accuracy is
questionable, and they do not focus on the subfields of an area. When
selecting a graduate school, students should look for schools which
not only have excellent programs in their general area of research
but also at least one faculty member whose research interests mesh
well with the student's. Accordingly, we've broken down this list
according to topic, and sorted the schools within each topic in
ALPHABETICAL ORDER. 

For a school to be added to a topic area, there should at least two
faculty actively conducting research in that area and the school
should have a "good" reputation in that area. Exceptions are made for
schools which only have one faculty member in the area, but that
professor is a "leader" of the area, or for fields where the total
number of people working in the area is small in the first place. The
general idea behind these criteria is to ensure that a school has
enough activity in the area that a student who considers one of these
schools won't be disappointed if one of the faculty in that area is on
sabbatical or isn't taking students. Note that the research need not
be conducted in the school's computer science department for the
school to be listed -- in some cases we've included schools where the
research is being conducted in a different department or special laboratory.

The best way for students to discover which schools are good in a
field is to ask professors (and graduate students) in their
undergraduate school for suggestions on where to apply. Reading the
research journals in the field is another good method (see part 3 of
the FAQ).

A genealogy of AI thesis-advising relationships is available by
anonymous ftp as 
   cs.ucsd.edu:/pub/rik/aigen.rpt
Although intended to complement citation analysis and free-text
information retrieval as tools for understanding the AI community and
their connections to other disciplines, it may be useful to
prospective graduate students. For example, it may help you understand
the historical context of a given professor's perspective.  2,600 MS
and PhD theses have been tabulated so far.  If you'd like to
contribute additional listings (including year, title, abstract,
school, advisor, committee members, and subsequent employment), write
to Rik Belew <rik@cs.ucsd.edu> or fax 619-534-7029, for the
questionnaire. A copy of the questionaire and more information is
available in 
   cs.ucsd.edu:/pub/rik/announce.t

A list of email addresses for CS departments is posted once a month to
the newsgroup soc.college.gradinfo.

The Association for Computational Linguistics publishes a directory of
graduate programs in Computational Linguistics ($15 for members, $30
for others). It includes several useful indices (e.g., index of
faculty and a list of references). Contact Association for
Computational Linguistics, Walker, C. N. 925, Bernardsville, NJ
07924-0925, phone/fax 908-204-1337, or send email to acl@bellcore.com.

NOTE THAT THIS LIST IS PRELIMINARY AND BY NO MEANS COMPLETE.

Subject: [1-5] What are the rules for the game of "Life"?

Cellular Automata, of which Life is an example, were suggested by
Stanislaw Ulam in the 1940s, and first formalized by von Neumann.
Conway's "Game of Life" was popularized in Martin Gardner's
mathematical games column in the October 1970 and February 1971 issues
of Scientific American.  (Shorter notes on life are alse given in the
column in each month from October 1970 to April 1971, and well as
November 1971, January 1972, and December 1972.) There's also quite a
bit on the game in "The Recursive Universe", by William Poundstone,
Oxford University Press, 1987, 252 pages.
 
The rules for the game of life are quite simple. The game board is a
rectangular cell array, with each cell either empty or filled. At each
tick of the clock, we generate the next generation by the following rules:

        if a cell is empty, fill it if 3 of its neighbors are filled
        (otherwise leave it empty)

        if a cell is filled, it
                dies of loneliness if it has 1 or fewer neighbors
                continues to live if it has 2 or 3 neighbors
                dies of overcrowding if it has more than 3 neighbors

Neighbors include the cells on the diagonals. Some implementations use
a torus-based array (edges joined top-to-bottom and left-to-right) for
computing neighbors. 

For example, a row of 3 filled cells will become a column of 3 filled
cells in the next generation. The R pentomino is an interesting
pattern: 
      xx
     xx
      x
Try it with other patterns of 5 cells initially occupied. If you
record the ages of cells, and map the ages to colors, you can get a
variety of beautiful images.

When implementing Life, be sure to maintain separate arrays for the
old and new generation. Updating the array in place will not work
correctly. Another optimization to to maintain a list of the cells
that changed.

Conway has demonstrated that it is possible to construct the basic
building blocks of a computer from Life using modified glider guns.
See the last chapter of  
   Elwyn R. Berlekamp, John H. Conway, and Richard K. Guy, "Winning
   Ways", Academic Press, New York, 1982, ISBN 0-120911-507.

Subject: [1-6] What AI competitions exist?

The Loebner Prize, based on a fund of over $100,000 established by New
York businessman Hugh G. Loebner, is awarded annually for the computer
program that best emulates natural human behavior. During the
contest, a panel of independent judges attempts to determine whether
the responses on a computer terminal are being produced by a computer
or a person, along the lines of the Turing Test. The designers of the
best program each year win a cash award and a medal. If a program
passes the test in all its particulars, then the entire fund will be
paid to the program's designer and the fund abolished. For further
information about the Loebner Prize, write Dr. Robert Epstein,
Executive Director, Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies, 11
Waterhouse Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, or call 617-491-9020.

Stiquito is a small (3cm H x 7cm W x 6cm L), simple (32 parts) and
inexpensive (< $30) nitinol-propelled hexapod robot developed at the
Indiana University (Bloomington) Robotics Laboratory.  Its legs are
propelled by nitnol actuator wires. Each leg has one degree of freedom.
The robot walks up to 10 centimeters per minute and can carry a 9-volt
cell, a MOSIS "tiny chip" and power transistors to drive the nitinol
actuator wires. Nitinol wire (aka BioMetal, Flexinol), is a nickel-titanium
alloy which exerts useful force as it is heated by passing a current
through it. IUCS Technical Report 363a describes Stiquito's construction
and is available by anonymous ftp from 
   cs.indiana.edu:/pub/stiquito/ [129.79.254.191]

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-9] Future Directions of AI

The purpose of this question is to compile a list of major ongoing and
future thrusts of AI. To be included in this list a research problem
or application must have the following characteristics:

   [1]  Collaborative Community Effort: It must span several subfields
        of AI, requiring some degree of collaboration between AI
        researchers of different specialties. The idea is to help
        unify the fragmented subfields with a common purpose or
        purposes. 

   [2]  High Impact: It must address important problems of widespread interest.
        Solving the problem must matter to many people and not simply
        be adding another grain of sand on the anthill. This will help
        motivate and excite researchers, and justify the field to outsiders.

   [3]  Short Horizon for Progress: It must be possible to have incremental
        progress and not be an all or nothing problem. For example,
        problems where we can reasonably expect to make significant
        measurable progress over the next 10 years or so.

   [4]  Drive Basic Research: It should involve more than just
        applying current technology, but should drive basic research
        and the development of new technology (possibly in completely
        new directions). 

In short, these problems should be "Grand Challenges" for AI. If you
were trying to describe the field of AI to a layman, what concrete
problems would you use to illustrate the overall vision of the field?
Saying that the goal of AI is to produce "thinking machines that solve
problems" doesn't quite cut it.

   o  Knowbots/Infobots and Intelligent Help Desks
         Unifies NLU, NLG, Information Retrieval, KR, Reasoning,
         Intelligent User Interfaces, Qualitative Reasoning.

   o  Autonomous Vehicles
         Unifies Robotics, Machine Vision, Machine Learning,
         Intelligent Control, Planning

   o  Machine Translation
         Unifies NLU, NLG, Knowledge Representation, Speech Understanding,
         Speech Synthesis 

Additional problems are, of course, welcome. I have not included the
Loebner Prize (e.g., passing the unrestricted Turing Test) in the list
because it doesn't address a high impact problem.

It seems appropriate to mention, in this context, some of the early
goals of AI.  In 1958 Newell and Simon predicted that computers would
-- by 1970 -- be capable of composing classical music, discovering
important new mathematical theorems, playing chess at grandmaster
level, and understanding and translating spoken language. Although
these predictions were overly optimistic, they did represent a set of
focused goals for the field of AI. [See H. A. Simon and A. Newell,
"Heuristic Problem Solving: The Next Advance in Operations Research",
Operation Research, pages 1-10, January-February 1958.]

This part of the AI FAQ provides a bibliography of good introductory
texts and overviews of AI and specific subfields of AI. If you feel
that there is a reference or set of references which should be added
to this FAQ, or references which should be removed, please send email
to mkant+ai-faq@cs.cmu.edu.  When suggesting references to be
included in a particular subfield, only suggest the best two or three
references (or a particularly well-written overview). It is NOT the
intention of this listing to be a comprehensive AI bibliography.

Books suggested by their authors must present a strongly argued case.
Also, I generally will include books in this list only after I have
had a chance to look at them.  If you are the author or publisher of a
new AI-related text, and you want me to consider your book for this
list, send a complimentary copy to Mark Kantrowitz, School of Computer
Science, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh,
PA 15213-3891 USA. Please don't waste my time with books that are
clearly not appropriate for this list. When I am done with the book I
will donate it to the CMU Engineering & Science Library.

Subject: [0] AI book publication announcements mailing list

The AI BOOK ANNOUNCEMENTS mailing list exists to inform the AI
community about the publication of new AI-related books. 

Material appropriate for the list includes announcements of BOOKS
about Artificial Intelligence and its subfields, Lisp, Prolog, and
related topics and should be sent to ai+book-announce@cs.cmu.edu.

Please include a line of the form
   Slug: AuthorSlug
in the publication announcement, where "AuthorSlug" should be replaced
with a filename for the announcement. The format for file names is the
author's last name followed by the year. For example, a book by James
Allen published in 1995 would be given the slug allen95. This slug
will be used for archiving the publication announcement. Please also
use the following standard for subject lines; this example is again
based on James Allen's book. 
   Subject: Book: James Allen, Natural Language Understanding, 2e 

To subscribe, send a message to ai+query@cs.cmu.edu with
   subscribe book-announce <First Name> <Last Name>, <Affiliation/Organization>
in the message body and no Subject line. 

For help on using the query server, send mail to ai+query@cs.cmu.edu with
   help
in the message body.

All publication announcements are archived in the directory

   [Includes algorithms implemented in Lisp and Prolog.]

   Ian Pratt, "Artificial Intelligence", Macmillan, London, 1994. 280
   pages, ISBN 0-333-59755-9 ($35). [In-depth introduction to several
   AI topics, using inference as a central theme. As a result, omits
   topics like NLP, expert systems, vision, and robotics. But does,
   curiously, include a chapter on neural networks, in addition to
   planning, search, and other topics related to logic and reasoning.
   The presentation is superb, doing an excellent job of conveying the
   essential insights behind the concepts, followed by the technical
   details and pseudocode for the algorithms. Very good use of diagrams
   to explain difficult concepts. Heavily dependent on predicate
   calculus, with a tutorial introduction in the appendix. Suitable
   for an advanced undergraduate/introductory masters-level course. A

Subject: [1b] How do I get a copy of the proceedings to conference <x>?

First, ask your librarian for help. If your local library doesn't have it,
they may be able to get it on interlibrary loan.

If you want to buy your own copy, first check with the organization
that ran the conference. See part 3 of the AI FAQ for a list of many
of the AI organizations that sponsor conferences.

If they can't help you, contact the Institute for Scientific Information
(ISI), and look up the proceedings in their Index to Scientific and
Technical Proceedings (ISTP volumes). You can contact the ISI at

   Institute for Scientific Information, Inc.

Subject: [1c] How do I get a copy of <x>'s PhD dissertation?

Most dissertations from US universities are available from

Phone: 800-521-0600 (313-761-4700)
       800-343-5299 (in Canada)

They will print a copy of the dissertation from microfilm and bind it
in paperbound or cloth for a reasonable fee.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1d] Tech Reports, Abstracts, etc.

The easiest and cheapest way to get a copy of a tech report, paper, or
thesis is to send email to the author. Most researchers will be happy
to drop a copy of the report to you in the mail, or give you a pointer
to an online copy. In some cases they may direct you to a central
technical report coordinator for their department (see [6-2]), and
getting a copy may involve a nominal fee.

Subject: [5-0] General Information about FTP Resources for AI

Remember, when ftping compressed or compacted files (.Z, .gz, .arc, .fit,
etc.) to use binary mode for retrieving the files.

Files that end with a .gz suffix were compressed with the patent-free
gzip (no relation to zip). Source for gzip is available from
   prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/
as the files gzip-1.2.3.shar, gzip-1.2.3.tar,or gzip-1.2.3.msdos.exe.

If you do not have ftp access, you can FTP files by E-mail. Send a
message with the word "help" in the body to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com. As
the DECWRL ftpmail server is overloaded, you are encouraged to use an
alternate ftpmail server, such as ftpmail@cs.uow.edu.au (Australia),
ftpmail@ftp.uni-stuttgart.de (Germany), ftpmail@grasp.insa-lyon.fr
(France), ftpmail@doc.ic.ac.uk (Great Britain), ftpmail@ieunet.ie
(Ireland), ftpmail@lth.se (Sweden), ftpmail@sunsite.unc.edu (USA),
ftpmail@ftp.uu.net (USA, message relayed to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com, so
don't use it), ftpmail@gallifrey.ucs.uoknor.edu (USA), or
ftpmail@seds.lpl.arizona.edu (USA). If you're on BITNET, send a
message with the word "help" in the body to BITFTP@PUCC, BITFTP@PLEARN
or BITFTP@DEARN (Internet equivalents bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu,
bitftp@plearn.edu.pl and bitftp@vm.gmd.de, respectively).

In general, see the Lisp FAQ for Lisp-related software and the Prolog
Resource Guide and the Prolog FAQ for Prolog-related software. If a
Lisp-based or Prolog-based system is listed here, only the ftp site
and directory will be listed; for a more detailed description, see the
Lisp FAQ and the Prolog Resource Guide. For information on obtaining
the Lisp FAQ or the Prolog Resource Guide see [1-0].

When referring to software, "alpha" indicates an internal early
release, "beta" indicates an external early release, and "omega"
indicates an external "finished" release. Generally an "alpha" release
means the creator hasn't yet tested for bugs.

Subject: [5-1] FTP Repositories

CMU AI Repository:

   The CMU Artificial Intelligence Repository was established by
   Carnegie Mellon University to contain public domain and freely
   distributable software, publications, and other materials of
   interest to AI researchers, educators, students, and practitioners. 
   The AI Repository currently contains more than a gigabyte of
   material and is growing steadily. 

   The AI Repository is accessible for free by anonymous FTP, AFS, and
   WWW. A selection of materials from the AI Repository is also being
   published on CD-ROM by Prime Time Freeware and is available for
   purchase by mail or fax (see [6-5] for more information).

   The AI Repository is accessible by anonymous FTP from
      ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/            [128.2.206.173]
   by AFS (Andrew File System) from
      /afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/
   and by WWW from the URL   
      http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/AI/html/repository.html
   Be sure to read the files 0.doc and readme.txt in this directory.

   The AI Repository is still under construction, but to date, the
   AI Programming Languages and the AI Software Packages sections
   are "complete". These can be accessed in the lang/ and areas/
   subdirectories of the AI Repository. Compression and archiving
   utilities may be found in the util/ subdirectory.  Other directories,
   which are in varying states of completion, are events/ (Calendar of
   Events, Conference Calls) and pubs/ (Publications, including technical
   reports, books, mail/news archives).

   The AI Programming Languages section of the repository includes
   directories for Common Lisp, Prolog, Scheme, Smalltalk, and
   other AI-related programming languages. 

   The AI Software Packages section of the repository includes
   subdirectories for:

      agents/      Intelligent Agent Architectures 
      alife/       Artificial Life and Complex Adaptive Systems
      anneal/      Simulated Annealing

   The repository has standardized on using 'tar' for producing
   archives of files and 'gzip' for compression.

   To search the keyword index by mail, send a message to:
      ai+query@cs.cmu.edu
   with one or more lines containing calls to the keys command, such as:
      keys lisp iteration
   in the message body.  Keywords may be regular expressions and are
   compared with the index in a case-insensitive conjunctive fashion.  
   You'll get a response by return mail. Do not include anything else in 
   the Subject line of the message or in the message body.  For help on
   the query mail server, include: 
      help
   instead. 

   A Mosaic interface to the keyword searching program is accessible
   through the URL
      http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/AI/html/keys/keysform.html

   We plan on making the source code (including indexes) to
   this keyword searching program available, as soon as it is stable.

   We hope to eventually have a fully automated calendar of events,
   an expanded AI Publications directory, mailing list and newsgroup
   archives, and much much more. 

   Contributions of software and other materials are always welcome but
   must be accompanied by an unambiguous copyright statement that grants
   permission for free use, copying, and distribution -- either a
   declaration by the author that the materials are in the public domain,
   that the materials are subject to the GNU General Public License (cite
   version), or that the materials are subject to copyright, but the
   copyright holder grants permission for free use, copying, and
   distribution. (We will tell you if the copying permissions are too
   restrictive for us to include the materials in the repository.)
   Inclusion of materials in the repository does not modify their
   copyright status in any way. Materials may be placed in:
      ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/new/
   When you put anything in this directory, please send mail to
      ai+contrib@cs.cmu.edu
   giving us permission to distribute the files, and state whether
   this permission is just for the AI Repository, or also includes
   publication on the CD-ROM version (Prime Time Freeware for AI).
   We would also appreciate if you would include a 0.doc file for your
   package; see /user/ai/new/package.doc for a template. (If you don't
   have the time to write your own, we can write it for you based on
   the information in your package.)

   For more information on the CMU AI Repository, please send mail to
   Mark Kantrowitz <AI.Repository@cs.cmu.edu>. 

   Known mirrors:

          ftp.sunet.se:/pub/lang/lisp/

Ada Repository:

   The Ada Repository on wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (mailing list
   ada-sw@wsmr-simtel20.army.mil) contains a directory of AI programs in
   PD2:<ADA.AI>*.*. A somewhat easier to access copy of the archives is
   available as wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors/ada/ai/.

UCLA Artificial Life Depository:

   ftp.cognet.ucla.edu:/pub/alife/ [128.97.8.19]

   Repository of papers, articles, tech reports, software and other items of
   interest to Artificial Life researchers. It includes an archive of
   past postings to the alife mailing list, alife@cognet.ucla.edu (send
   mail to alife-request@cognet.ucla.edu to be added to the list).

Artificial Life Online and the Artificial Life BBS:

   Sponsored by MIT Press and the Santa Fe Institute, Artificial Life
   Online and the Artificial Life BBS is intended to be a central
   information collection and distribution site on the Internet for any
   and all aspects of the Artificial Life endeavor.

   A special feature of the BBS is a collection of 40 or so local
   newsgroups dedicated to a wide variety of topics in Artificial Life.

   Artificial Life Online is accessible by anonymous ftp from
      alife.santafe.edu:/pub/ [192.12.12.99]
   by World-Wide Web from
      http://alife.santafe.edu/
   and by Gopher from
      gopher://alife.santafe.edu:70/

   To access the Alife Online BBS (ALBBS) by telnet, telnet to
   alife.santafe.edu and login as "bbs". You will find yourself in a
   specially constructed UNIX shell within which either BBS menu commands
   or UNIX commands can be used to browse around in the system. Run the
   "account" program to set up a local account. These accounts will
   initially be provided free of charge, but they will eventually have to
   charge a nominal fee in order to cover operating expenses (on the
   order of $15-$25 per year). Subscribers to the Artificial Life Journal
   from MIT Press will have this fee waived. Once you have an account on
   alife.santafe.edu, you can telnet to alife.santafe.edu and login as
   yourself. You do not have to create an account to use the ALBBS via
   telnet -- you can simply login as "bbs" and browse through the system
   using the BBS commands.

   Please send suggestions and questions about the Alife Online/BBS
   system to feedback@alife.santafe.edu.

Machine Learning Algorithms Implemented in Prolog:

   In 1988 the Special Interest Group on Machine Learning of the German
   Society for Computer Science (GI e.V.) decided to establish a library
   of PROLOG implementations of Machine Learning algorithms. The library
   includes - amongst others - PROLOG implementations of Winston's arch, 
   Becker's AQ-PROLOG, Fisher's COBWEB, Brazdil's generation of 
   discriminations from derivation trees, Quinlan's ID3, FOIL, IDT,
   substitution matching, explanation based generalization, inverse 
   resolution, and Mitchell's version spaces algorithm. 
   All algorithms are written in Edinburgh Prolog syntax. Most of the
   algorithms are copyleft under the GNU General Public License. 
   The programs are currently available via anonymous ftp-server from
   the GMD: 

        ftp.gmd.de:/gmd/mlt/ML-Program-Library/ [129.26.8.84]

   They are also available by surface mail from Thomas Hoppe, 
   Projektgruppe KIT, Technische Universitaet Berlin, Franklinstr. 28/29,
   10629 Berlin, Germany. Files will be distributed via MS-DOS formated
   3.5 inch floppy (double, high and extra-high density),  which should
   be included with your request. You can also get them by sending an email
   message to Thomas Hoppe (see below).

   Send additional PROLOG implementations of Machine Learning
   Algorithms, complaints about them and detected bugs or problems

Subject: [5-2a] FTP and Other Resources: Agents -- Planning

In addition to programs available free by anonymous ftp, we've
included some programs which are available by contacting the authors,
and some programs which charge a nominal fee.

Agent Modelling:

   ANIMALS is a simulation system written by Toby Tyrrell,
   <toby@castle.ed.ac.uk>, for his PhD thesis.  The thesis examines the
   problem of action selection when dealing with realistic, animal-like
   situations: how to choose, at each moment in time, the most
   appropriate out of a repertoire of possible actions.  It includes a
   description is given of a simulated environment which is an extensive
   and detailed simulation of the problem of action selection for
   animals.  This simulated environment is used to investigate the
   adequacy of several theories of action selection (from both ethology
   and artificial intelligence) such as the drive model, Lorenz's
   psycho-hydraulic model and Maes' spreading activation network, and
   outlines deficiencies in each mechanism. Finally, it proposes a new
   approach to action selection is developed which determines the most
   appropriate action in a principled way, and which does not suffer from
   the inherent shortcomings found in other methods. The thesis includes
   a review and bibliography of existing work on action selection. The
   thesis is available by anonymous ftp from 
      ftp.ed.ac.uk:/pub/lrtt/ [129.215.146.5]
   as the files as.1.ps.Z, as.2.ps.Z, ..., and as.7.ps.Z.
   The simulation software is also available from the same site, as the
   file se.tar.Z. The simulation software was written in Suntools rather
   than Xtools.  It can be run only from SunView or OpenWindows.  The
   action selection problem modelled by the simulated environment
   comprises 15 different `sub-problems' (getting food, reproducing, not
   getting lost, being vigilant for predators, etc), many internal and
   external stimuli, and 35 different low-level actions to select
   between.

   ViewGen (Viewpoint Generator) is a Prolog program that implements a
   "Belief Ascription Algorithm" as described in Ballim and Wilks (see the
   bibliography section on User Modelling).  This can be seen as a form of
   agent modelling tool, which allows for the generation of arbitrarily deep
   nested belief spaces based on the system's own beliefs, and on beliefs 
   that are typically held by groups of agents.  ViewGen is available by
   anonymous ftp from 
      crl.nmsu.edu:/pub/non-lexical/ViewFinder [128.123.1.18] (user anonymous)
      ftp.ims.uni-stuttgart.de:/pub/ballim    [141.58.127.8] (user ftp)
   as the file ViewGen.tar.Z. The theory of belief ascription upon which
   it is based is described in detail in Ballim and Wilks, and a general
   framework for attributing and maintaining nested propositional
   attitudes is described in Afzal Ballim's dissertation which is
   archived with the Viewgen program (in the files 
      ViewFinder-{A4/A5/US}.tar.Z, 
   the variable part indicating the format of the PostScript file).
   The inheritance reasoner is in the file vf-hetis.tar.Z.
   Implemented in Sicstus prolog, and hence easily convertible to
   any Edinburgh-style prolog. Contact Afzal Ballim <afzal@divsun.unige.ch>

Artificial Life:

   Tierra is an artificial life system for studying the evolution of
   digital organisms. Tierra consists of a virtual computer and its
   operating system, whose architecture has been designed in such a way
   that the executable machine codes are evolvable.  This means that the
   machine code can be mutated (by flipping bits at random) or recombined
   (by swapping segments of code between algorithms), and the resulting
   code remains functional enough of the time for natural (or presumably
   artificial) selection to be able to improve the code over time.
   Tierra runs in Unix and MS-DOS. Source code and documentation is
   available by anonymous ftp at 
      tierra.slhs.udel.edu:/almond/ [128.175.41.34]

Constraint Programming and Non-determinism:

   SCREAMER:

   Screamer is an extension of Common Lisp that adds support for
   nondeterministic programming.  Screamer consists of two levels.  The
   basic nondeterministic level adds support for backtracking and
   undoable side effects.  On top of this nondeterministic substrate,
   Screamer provides a comprehensive constraint programming language in
   which one can formulate and solve mixed systems of numeric and
   symbolic constraints.  Together, these two levels augment Common Lisp
   with practically all of the functionality of both Prolog and
   constraint logic programming languages such as CHiP and CLP(R).
   Furthermore, Screamer is fully integrated with Common Lisp. Screamer
   programs can coexist and interoperate with other extensions to Common
   Lisp such as CLOS, CLIM and Iterate.

   In several ways Screamer is more efficient than other implementations
   of backtracking languages.  First, Screamer code is transformed into
   Common Lisp which can be compiled by the underlying Common Lisp
   system.  Many competing implementations of nondeterministic Lisp are
   interpreters and thus are far less efficient than Screamer.  Second,
   the backtracking primitives require fairly low overhead in Screamer.
   Finally, this overhead to support backtracking is only paid for those
   portions of the program which use the backtracking primitives.
   Deterministic portions of user programs pass through the Screamer to
   Common Lisp transformation unchanged.  Since in practise, only small
   portions of typical programs utilize the backtracking primitives,
   Screamer can produce more efficient code than compilers for languages
   in which backtracking is more pervasive.

   Screamer is fairly portable across most Common Lisp implementations.
   It currently runs under Genera 8.1.1 and 8.3 on both Symbolics 36xx
   and Ivory machines, under Lucid 4.0.2 and 4.1 on Sun SPARC machines,
   under MCL 2.0 and 2.0p2 on Apple Macintosh machines, and under Poplog
   Common Lisp on Sun SPARC machines.  It should run under any
   implementation of Common Lisp which is compliant with CLtL2 and with
   minor revision could be made to run under implementations compliant
   with CLtL1 or dpANS.

   Screamer is available by anonymous FTP from 
      ftp.ai.mit.edu:/pub/screamer.tar.Z
   Contact Jeffrey Mark Siskind <qobi@ai.mit.edu> for further information.

   The Screamer Tool Repository, a collection of user-contributed
   Screamer code, is available by anonymous ftp from

Defeasible Reasoning:

   An implementation of J. Paris and A. Vencovska's model of belief is
   available by anonymous ftp from
      ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/areas/reasonng/defeasbl/belief/
   Paris and Vencovska's paper (Artificial Intelligence, 64(2), December
   1993) provides a mathematical model of an agent's belief in an event
   by identifying it with his ability to imagine the event within the
   context of his previous experience.  This approach leads to beliefs
   having properties different from those normally ascribed to it. The
   implementation was written by Ian Pratt <ipratt@cs.man.ac.uk> and Jens
   Doerpmund <dorpmunj@cs.man.ac.uk> and runs in Common Lisp.

   GPQUICK is a simple GP system implemented in C++.  It features an
   elegant object architecture with function (Function), program
   (Chrome), GA (Pop) and problem (Problem) classes.  The Problem class
   is proposed as a portable representation for problems that would be
   source compatible with a variety of other GP systems.  GPQUICK uses a
   steady state GA, tournament selection, one type of mutation, and
   subtree crossover.  It uses a fast, compact linear representation for
   S-expressions. It includes documentation from the associated magazine
   article (Byte, "Some Assembly Required", February 1994). GPQUICK is
   available by anonymous ftp from
      ftp.cc.utexas.edu:/pub/genetic-programming/code/
   as the files gpquick.tar (unix version, tested with CC and g++) and

   SNePS (Semantic Network Processing System) is the implementation of a
   fully intensional theory of propositional knowledge representation and
   reasoning. SNePS includes a module for creating and accessing
   propositional semantic networks, path-based inference, node-based
   inference based on SWM (a relevance logic with quantification) that
   uses natural deduction and can deal with recursive rules, forward,
   backward and bi-directional inference, nonstandard logical connectives
   and quantifiers, an assumption based TMS for belief revision (SNeBR), a
   morphological analyzer and a generalized ATN (GATN) parser for parsing
   and generating natural language, SNePSLOG, a predicate-logic-style
   interface to SNePS, XGinseng, an X-based graphics interface for
   displaying, creating and editing SNePS networks, SNACTor, a
   preliminary version of the SNePS Acting component, and SNIP 2.2, a new
   implementation of the SNePS Inference Package that uses rule shadowing
   and knowledge migration to speed up inference.  SNeRE (the SNePS
   Rational Engine), which is part of Deepak Kumar's dissertation about
   the integration of inference and acting, will replace the current
   implementation of SNACTor.  SNePS is written in Common Lisp, and has
   been tested in Allegro CL 4.1, Lucid CL 4.0, TI Common Lisp, CLISP
   May-93, and CMU CL 17b. It should also run in Symbolics CL, AKCL 1.600
   and higher, VAX Common Lisp, and MCL. The XGinseng interface is built
   on top of Garnet.  SNePS 2.1 is free according to the GNU General
   Public License version 2. The SNePS distribution is available by

   MOBAL is a system for developing operational models of application
   domains in a first order logic representation. It integrates a manual
   knowledge acquisition and inspection environment, an inference engine,
   machine learning methods for automated knowledge acquisition, and a
   knowledge revision tool.  By using MOBAL's knowledge acquisition
   environment, you can incrementally develop a model of your domain in
   terms of logical facts and rules.  You can inspect the knowledge you
   have entered in text or graphics windows, augment the knowledge, or
   change it at any time. The built-in inference engine can immediately
   execute the rules you have entered to show you the consequences of
   your inputs, or answer queries about the current knowledge. MOBAL also
   builds a dynamic sort taxonomy from your inputs. If you wish, you can
   use several machine learning methods to automatically discover
   additional rules based on the facts that you have entered, or to form
   new concepts. If there are contradictions in the knowledge base due to
   incorrect rules or facts, there is a knowledge revision tool to help
   you locate the problem and fix it.  MOBAL (release 3.0b) is available
   free for non-commercial academic use by anonymous ftp from
      ftp.gmd.de:/gmd/mlt/Mobal/
   The system runs on Sun SparcStations, SunOS 4.1, and includes a
   graphical interface implemented using Tcl/TK.

   OC1 (Oblique Classifier 1) is a multivariate decision tree induction
   system designed for applications where the instances have numeric
   feature values.  OC1 builds decision trees that contain linear
   combinations of one or more attributes at each internal node; these
   trees then partition the space of examples with both oblique and
   axis-parallel hyperplanes.  OC1 has been used for classification of
   data from several real world domains, such as astronomy and cancer
   diagnosis.  A technical decription of the algorithm can be found in
   the AAAI-93 paper by Sreerama K. Murthy, Simon Kasif, Steven Salzberg
   and Richard Beigel.  A postscript version of this paper is included in
   the distribution. OC1 is a written entirely in ANSI C. OC1 is

   Set-Enumeration (SE) Trees for Induction/Classification. Significant
   research in Machine Learning, and in Statistics, has been devoted to
   the induction and use of decision trees as classifiers.  An induction
   framework which generalizes decision trees using a Set-Enumeration
   (SE) tree is outlined in  
      Rymon, R. (1993), An SE-tree-based Characterization of the Induction
      Problem. In Proc. of the Tenth International Conference on Machine
      Learning, Amherst MA, pp. 268-275.
   In this framework, called SE-Learn, rather than splitting according to
   a single attribute, one recursively branches on all (or most) relevant
   attributes. An induced SE-tree can be shown to economically embed many
   decision trees, thereby supporting a more expressive hypothesis
   representation. Also, by branching on many attributes, SE-Learn
   removes much of the algorithm-dependent search bias. Implementations
   of SE-Learn can benefit from many techniques developed for decision
   trees (e.g., attribute-selection and pruning measures). In particular,
   SE-Learn can be tailored to start off with one's favorite decision
   tree, and then improve upon it by further exploring the SE-tree. This
   hill-climbing algorithm allows trading time/space for added accuracy.
   Current studies (yet unpublished) show that SE-trees are particularly
   advantageous in domains where (relatively) few examples are available
   for training, and in noisy domains. Finally, SE-trees can provide a
   unified framework for combining induced knowledge with knowledge
   available from other sources (Rymon, 1994).

   MUME (Multi-Module Neural Computing Environment) is a simulation
   environment for multi-modules neural computing. It provides an object
   oriented facility for the simulation and training of multiple nets
   with various architectures and learning algorithms.  The object
   oriented structure makes simple the addition of new network classes
   and new learning algorithms. MUME includes a library of network
   architectures including feedforward, simple recurrent, and
   continuously running recurrent neural networks.  Each architecture is
   supported by a variety of learning algorithms, including backprop,
   weight perturbation, node perturbation, and simulated annealing.  MUME
   can be used for large scale neural network simulations as it provides
   support for learning in multi-net environments. It also provide pre-
   and post-processing facilities.  MUME can be used to include
   non-neural computing modules (decision trees, etc.) in applications. _
   MUME is being developed at the Machine Intelligence Group at Sydney
   University Electrical Engineering. The software is written in 'C' and
   is being used on Sun and DEC workstations. Efforts are underway to
   port it to the Fujitsu VP2200 vector processor using the VCC
   vectorising C compiler, HP 9000/700, SGI workstations, DEC
   Alphas, and PC DOS (with DJGCC). MUME is available to research
   institutions on a media/doc/postage cost arrangement after

   ToolDiag
   ToolDiag is a feature selection program that increases the accuracy of
   classifiers and reduces their complexity by providing them with a
   subset containing only the most relevant features. It has interfaces
   to LVQ_PAK and SNNS, and uses a data file format that is compatible

   GNUPLOT plotting package. ToolDiag implements many concepts from
   Devijver and Kittler's book "Pattern Recognition -- A Statistical
   Approach" (Prentice Hall, 1982), including the optimal branch and
   bound search strategy, together with several different selection
   criteria. ToolDiag can also perform an error estimation using the
   leave-one-out method and a K-nearest-neighbor classifier. It also
   includes a learning module (Q*) that has the same functionality as
   LVQ. ToolDiag cannot handle missing values and requires continuous or
   ordered discrete numerical features. ToolDiag is implemented in C and

   The HYPERPLANE ANIMATOR is a program that allows convenient graphical
   display of the training data and weights in a back-propagation neural
   network.  As learning progresses and the weights in a neural net
   alter, the hyperplane positions move.  At the end of the training they
   are in positions that roughly divide training data into partitions,
   each of which contains only one class of data.  Observations of
   hyperplane movement can yield valuable insights into neural network
   learning.  The Animator, developed by Lori Pratt and Steve Nicodemus
   of the Colorado School of Mines, uses the Motif toolkit on an IBM
   RS6000 with X-Windows.  The system currently animates only hyperplanes
   representing input-to-hidden weights.  The animator is available by
   anonymous ftp from
      mines.colorado.edu:/pub/software/hyperplane-animator/ [138.67.1.3]
   as the file hyperplane-animator.tar. An openwindows version of the
   animator is available by anonymous ftp from

   radii of the RBS units. The program is not intended for any serious
   applications and is quite slow, but may be of interest to some people.
   It is available by anonymous ftp from
      rhino.cis.vutbr.cz:/pub/software/ai/suzy.tar.Z [147.229.3.10]
   For further information, contact tgrove@psycho.fme.vutbr.cz.

   MBP (Matrix Back Propagation) is an efficient implementation of the
   back-propagation algorithm for current-generation workstations.  The
   algorithm includes a per-epoch adaptive technique for gradient
   descent.  All the computations are done through matrix multiplications
   and make use of highly optimized C code. The goal is to reach almost
   peak-performances on RISCs with superscalar capabilities and fast
   caches.  On some machines (and with large networks) a 30-40x speed-up
   can be measured respect to conventional implementations.  
   The software is available by anonymous ftp from
      risc6000.dibe.unige.it:/pub/ [130.251.89.154]

Neural Systems (Biological Simulation):

   BIOSIM is a biologically-oriented neural network simulator.  It
   implements four neuron models: a simple model only switching ion
   channels on and off, the original Hodgkin-Huxley model, the SWIM model
   (a modified HH model) and the Golowasch-Buchholz model (the most
   enhanced model). Dendrites consist of a chain of segments without
   bifurcation.  It is in the public domain and runs on Unix workstations
   (a less-powerful PC version is also available). BIOSIM includes a
   graphical user interface and was designed for research and teaching.
   It is available by anonymous ftp from
      ftp.uni-kl.de:/pub/bio/neurobio [131.246.9.95]
   For more information, write to Stefan Bergdoll <bergdoll@zxa.basf-ag.de>.

   GENESIS (GEneral NEural SImulation System) is a general purpose
   simulation platform which supports the simulation of neural systems
   ranging from complex models of single neurons to simulations of large
   networks made up of more abstract neuronal components.  Most current
   GENESIS applications involve realistic simulations of biological
   neural systems.  Although the software can also model more abstract
   networks, other simulators are more suitable for backpropagation and
   similar connectionist modeling.  GENESIS and its graphical front-end
   XODUS are written in C and run on SUN and DEC graphics work stations
   under UNIX (Sun version 4.0 and up, Ultrix 3.1, 4.0 and up), and
   X-windows (versions X11R3, X11R4, and X11R5).  The current version of
   GENESIS has also been used with Silicon Graphics (Irix 4.0.1 and up)
   and the HP 700 series (HPUX).  The distribution includes full source
   code and documentation for both GENESIS and XODUS as well as fourteen
   demonstration and tutorial simulations.  Documentation for these
   simulations is included, along with three papers that describe the
   general organization of the simulator.  GENESIS is available by
   anonymous ftp from genesis.cns.caltech.edu (131.215.137.64). Before
   using ftp, you must telnet to genesis.cns.caltech.edu and login as the
   user "genesis" (no password required) to register.  If you answer all
   the questions asked of you an 'ftp' account will automatically be
   created for you.  You can then 'ftp' back to the machine and download
   the software.  Further inquiries concerning GENESIS may be addressed
   to genesis@cns.caltech.edu.

   AbTweak is a complete hierarchical, non-linear planner that extends
   David Chapman's (MIT 1986) "Tweak" planner as described by
   Yang (Waterloo) and Tenenberg (Rochester) in 1989.  This implementation
   by Steven Woods (1991 Masters Thesis) includes a complete search 
   strategy suited to abstraction hierarchies known as LEFT-WEDGE (Woods 1991).
   This planner and related work predates that of SNLP. AbTweak has a 
   WWW homepage containing source & related papers accessible on 
      http://logos.uwaterloo.ca/sgwoods/ 
   AbTweak is also available by anonymous FTP from 
      logos.uwaterloo.ca:/pub/abtweak/

   The ARS MAGNA abstract robot simulator provides an abstract world in
   which a planner controls a mobile robot. This abstract world is more
   realistic than typical blocks worlds, in which micro-world simplifying
   assumptions do not hold. Experiments may be controlled by varying
   global world parameters, such as perceptual noise, as well as building
   specific environments in order to exercise particular planner
   features. The world is also extensible to allow new experimental
   designs that were not thought of originally. The simulator also
   includes a simple graphical user-interface which uses the CLX
   interface to the X window system. ARS MAGNA can be obtained by
   anonymous ftp from 
      ftp.cs.yale.edu:/pub/nisp 
   as the file ars-magna.tar.Z. Installation instructions are in the file
   Installation.readme. The simulator is written in Nisp, a macro-package
   for Common Lisp. Nisp can be retrieved in the same way as the
   simulator. Version 1.0 of the ARS MAGNA simulator is documented in
   Yale Technical Report YALEU/DCS/RR #928, "ARS MAGNA: The Abstract
   Robot Simulator". This report is available in the distribution as a
   PostScript file. Comments should be directed to Sean Philip
   Engelson <engelson@cs.yale.edu>.

   Erratic, a mobile robot simulator and controller by konolige@ai.sri.com is
   available by anonymous ftp from
      ftp.ai.sri.com:pub/konolige/erratic-ver1.tar.Z

   The Michigan Intelligent Coordination Experiment (MICE) testbed is a
   tool for experimenting with coordination between intelligent systems
   under a variety of conditions.  MICE simulates a two-dimensional
   grid-world in which agents may move, communicate, and affect their
   environment.  MICE is essentially a discrete-event simulator that
   helps control the domain and a graphical representation, but provides
   relatively few constraints on the form of the domain and the agents'
   abilities.  Users may specify the time required by various activities,
   the constraints on an agents' sensors, the configuration of the domain
   and its properties, etc.  MICE runs under XWindows on Un*x boxes, on
   Macs, and on TI Explorers, with relatively consistent graphical
   displays.  Source code, documentation, and examples are available via
   anonymous ftp to ftp.eecs.umich.edu:/software/Mice/Mice.tar.Z.  MICE was
   produced by the University of Michigan's Distributed Intelligent Agent
   Group (UM DIAG).  For further information, write to
   umdiagmice@caen.engin.umich.edu.

   RSIM, a SGI-based simulator from the University of Melbourne, with very
   nice graphics, is available by anonymous ftp from
      krang.vis.citri.edu.au:/pub/robot
   Write to cdillon@vis.citri.edu.au for more information.
   
   Simderella is a robot simulator consisting of three programs: CONNEL
   (the controller), SIMMEL (the robot simulator), and BEMMEL (the
   X-windows oriented graphics back-end). SIMMEL performs a few matrix
   multiplications, based on the Denavit Hartenberg method, calculates
   velocities with the Newton-Euler scheme, and communicates with the
   other two programs.  BEMMEL only displays the robot.  CONNEL is the
   controller, which must be designed by the user (in the distributed
   version, CONNEL is a simple inverse kinematics routine.)  The programs
   use Unix sockets for communication, so you must have sockets, but you
   can run the programs on different machines.  The software is available
   by anonymous ftp from
      galba.mbfys.kun.nl:/pub/neuro-software/pd/ [131.174.82.73]
   as the file simderella.2.0.tar.gz. The software has been compiled using
   gcc on SunOS running under X11R4/5 on Sun3, Sun4, Sun Sparc 1, 2, and
   10, DEC Alpha, HP700, 386/486 (Linux), and Silicon Graphics
   architectures. For more information, send email to Patrick van der
   Smagt, <smagt@fwi.uva.nl>.

Search:

   AISEARCH is a C++ class library for search algorithms implemented by 
   Peter Bouthoorn <peter@icce.rug.nl>. It includes implementations of
   DFS, BFS, uniform cost, best-first, bidirectional DFS/BFS, and AND/OR
   DFS/BFS search algorithms. It is available by anonymous ftp from
   obelix.icce.rug.nl:/pub/peter/ as aisearch.zip or aisearch.tar.Z.

Simulated Annealing:

   ASA (Adaptive Simulated Annealing) is a powerful global optimization
   C-code algorithm especially useful for nonlinear and/or stochastic
   systems. Most current copies can be obtained by anonymous ftp from
      ftp.alumni.caltech.edu:/pub/ingber/ASA.tar.gz [131.215.48.62]
   an uncompressed version, asa, also is in that archive.  There are several
   related (p)reprints in the Caltech archive, including sa_pvt93.ps.Z,
   "Simulated annealing: Practice versus theory." The first VFSR code was
   developed by Lester Ingber in 1987, and the reprint of that paper is
   vfsr89.ps.Z, "Very fast simulated re-annealing".  If you cannot use
   ftp or ftpmail, then copies of the code are also available by email
   from the author at ingber@alumni.caltech.edu. To be added to the
   mailing list, send mail to asa-request@alumni.caltech.edu.

   The VFSR code was made publicly available in 1992 under the GNU GPL, by
   Lester Ingber and Bruce Rosen.  The last version of that code before
   the introduction of ASA is available via anonymous ftp from
   ringer.cs.utsa.edu:/pub/rosen/vfsr.tar.Z.  Bruce Rosen has a comparison
   study, "Function Optimization based on Advanced Simulated Annealing,"
   which is available via anonymous ftp from
   archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:/pub/neuroprose/rosen.advsim.ps.Z.
   [VFSR is no longer supported, but ASA is. --mk]

Speech:

   RECNET is a complete speech recognition system for the DARPA TIMIT and
   Resource Management tasks.  It uses recurrent networks to estimate phone
   probabilities and Markov models to find the most probable sequence of
   phones or words.  The system is a snapshot of evolving research code.
   There is no documentation other than published research papers.  It is
   configured for the two specific databases and is unlikely to be of use as
   a complete system for other tasks. It is available by anonymous ftp from
      svr-ftp.eng.cam.ac.uk:/misc/recnet-1.3.tar.Z
   Related publications can be found in 
      svr-ftp.eng.cam.ac.uk:/reports/ (see the ABSTRACT file first).
   You will need the relevant CDROMs, 150MByte of free space for TIMIT and
   300MByte for RM. If you use the code, the author would appreciate an
   email message so that he can keep you informed of new releases. Write to
   Tony Robinson, <ajr@eng.cam.ac.uk>, for more information.

   CELP 3.2a is available from super.org:/pub/celp_3.2a.tar.Z
   [192.31.192.1] with copies available on
   svr-ftp.eng.cam.ac.uk:/comp.speech/sources/ The code (C, FORTRAN,
   diskio) all has been built and tested on a Sun4 under SunOS4.1.3.  If
   you want to run it somewhere else, then you may have to do a bit of
   work.  (A Solaris 2.x-compatible release is planned soon.) Written by
   Joe Campbell <jpcampb@afterlife.ncsc.mil> of the Department of
   Defense. Distribution facilitated by Craig F. Reese
   <cfreese@super.org>, IDA/Supercomputing Research Center.

   The OGI Speech Tools are set of speech data manipulation tools
   developed at the Center for Spoken Language Understanding (CSLU) at
   the Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and Technology (Portland
   Oregon). The tools can be used to compute and display signal
   representations, label speech at different levels (e.g., phonetic,
   phonemic and word), train neural network classifiers, and display the
   output of classification or recognition algorithms time-aligned with
   the speech. The OGI Speech Tools were written in ANSI C.  The OGI
   Speech Tools are available by anonymous ftp from
      speech.cse.ogi.edu:/pub/tools/ 
   as ogitools.v1.0.tar.Z. For more information, write to Johan Schalkwyk
   <tools@cse.ogi.edu>. If you're using the tools, please let Johan know
   by sending him a mail message.

   PC Convolution is a educational software package that graphically
   demonstrates the convolution operation.  It runs on IBM PC compatibles

   TimeGraph-- Metric and Qualitative temporal reasoning system which
               handles (<, =, >) point relations, bounds on absolute
               calendar/clock times, and bounds on durations. Data entry
               and retrieval is through interval or point relations.
               The system is scalable in the sense that storage
               remains linear in the number of relations added.
               Efficient retrieval is achieved through a simple 
               timepoint numbering scheme and metagraph structure.
               See SIGART Bulletin 4 (3), pp. 21-25, July 1993.
               Contact: Lenhart Schubert (schubert@cs.rochester.edu)

   TimeGraph II (TG-II) handles the set of the relations of the Point
   Algebra and of the Pointizable Interval Algebra (also called Simple
   Interval Algebra by P. van Beek). Temporal relations are represented
   through a "timegraph", a graph partitioned into a collection of "time
   chains" which are automatically structured for efficiency. The system
   is scalable, in the sense that the storage tends to remain linear in
   the number of relations asserted. Efficient query handling is achieved
   through a time point numbering scheme and a "metagraph" data
   structure. TG-II is written in Common Lisp.  For a description of the
   theory underlying the system see:

	  Reasoning through Timegraphs", in Proceedings of IJCAI-93.

   TimeLogic-- The TimeLogic system is an interval-based forward
               chaining inference engine and database manager of
               temporal constraints.  Relational constraints,
               indicating relative order between intervals, are based
               on Allen's interval logic.  The TimeLogic system also
               supports durational constraints, indicating relative
               magnitude between intervals, and reference links, used
               for the explicit or automatic construction of interval
               hierarchies.  Constraints are posed and propagated in
               user-defined contexts with inheritance. Supports relative
               metric constraints but no absolute dates or times.
               Written in Common Lisp.

   TIE      -- Temporal Inference Engine.  Written in Common Lisp.
               Contact: E. Tsang (Essex University, UK)

   TCNM (Temporal Constraint Network Manager) manages non-disjunctive
   metric constraints on time-points and on durations in an integrated
   way. These constraints allow us express absolute, qualitative and
   metric constraints on time-points and on durations, which are managed
   in an integrated way. In the updating processes, a non-redundant and
   global consistent Temporal Constraint Network is always maintained by
   means of an efficient and complete propagation method, with a O(n**2)
   temporal complexity. Sound and complete retrieval processes have a
   constant cost. Written in Common Lisp.  For more information, contact
   Federico A. Barber <fbarber@dsic.upv.es>.  See also SIGART Bulletin
   4(3), July 1993.

   ISABELLE-93. Isabelle is a highly automated generic theorem prover
   written in Standard ML.  New logics are introduced by specifying their
   syntax and rules of inference.  Proof procedures can be expressed
   using tactics and tacticals. Isabelle comes with 8 different logics,
   including LCF, some modal logics, first-order logic, Zermelo-Fraenkel
   set theory, and higher-order logic. Isabelle-93 is not upwardly
   compatible with its predecessor, but comes with advice on converting
   to the new simplifier.  Isabelle-93 is available by anonymous ftp from
   the University of Cambridge,
      ftp.cl.cam.ac.uk:/ml/ [128.232.0.56]
   as Isabelle93.tar.gz. It is also available from the Technical

   KEIM is a collection of software modules, written in Common Lisp with
   CLOS, designed to be used in the production of theorem proving
   systems.  KEIM is intended to be used by those who want to build or
   use deduction systems (such as resolution theorem provers) without
   having to write the entire framework. KEIM is also suitable for
   embedding a reasoning component into another Common Lisp program.
   KEIM offers a range of datatypes implementing a logical language of
   type theory (higher order logic), in which first order logic can be
   embedded.  KEIM's datatypes and algorithms include: types; terms
   (symbols, applications, abstractions), environments (e.g., associating
   symbols with types); unification and substitutions; proofs, including
   resolution and natural deduction style. KEIM also provides
   functionality for the pretty-printing, error handling, formula parsing
   and user interface facilities which form a large part of any theorem

   Nqthm-1992 is the Boyer-Moore theorem prover. The 1992 version of the
   theorem prover is upwardly compatible with the previous (1987)
   version. Included in the distribution are thousands of Nqthm-checked
   theorems formulated by Bevier, Boyer, Brock, Bronstein, Cowles,
   Flatau, Hunt, Kaufmann, Kunen, Moore, Nagayama, Russinoff, Shankar,
   Talcott, Wilding, Yu, and others. The release of Nqthm-1992 includes
   three revised chapters of the book `A Computational Logic Handbook',
   including Chapter 4, on the formal logic for which the system is a
   prover, and Chapter 12, the reference guide to user commands.  Nqthm
   runs in Common Lisp, and has been tested in AKCL, CMU CL, Allegro CL,
   Lucid CL, MCL, and Symbolics CL. Nqthm-1992 is available by anonymous
   ftp from
      ftp.cli.com:/pub/nqthm/nqthm-1992/  [192.31.85.129]

   ATP Problems  -- anagram.mcs.anl.gov:/pub/ATP_Problems/*
                    Collection of ATP problems from Otter, CADE, and JAR.
                    The problems include algebra, analysis, circuits,
                    geometry, logic problems, Pelletier's problem set,
                    program verification, puzzles, set theory, and topology.

   The TPTP (Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers) Problem Library
   is a collection of test problems for automated theorem provers (ATPs),
   using the clausal normal form of 1st order predicate logic.  The goal
   of the TPTP is to provide a firm basis for the testing, evaluation,
   and comparison of ATP systems through a comprehensive library of ATP
   test problems in a general purpose format. The TPTP includes tools to
   convert the problems to existing ATP formats, such as the OTTER, MGTP,
   PTTP, SETHEO, and SPRFN formats.  Each problem includes a list of
   references and other relevant information.  The TPTP also aims to
   supply general guidelines outlining the requirements for ATP system
   evaluation. The TPTP can be obtained by anonymous ftp from either the
   Department of Computer Science, James Cook University, Australia,
      coral.cs.jcu.edu.au:/pub/research/tptp-library/   [137.219.17.4]

Subject: [6-2] Technical Reports available by FTP

This section lists the anonymous ftp sites for technical reports from
several universities and other organizations. Some of the sites
provide only an online catalog of technical reports, while the rest
make the actual reports available online. The email address listed is
that of the appropriate person to contact with questions about
ordering technical reports. 

When ftping compressed .Z files, remember to set the transfer type to
binary first, using the command
        ftp> binary

Other general locations for technical reports from several
universities include:
   wuarchive.wustl.edu:/doc/techreports/ [128.252.135.4]
   cs-archive.uwaterloo.edu:/cs-archive/  (see Index for an index)
      AKA watdragon.uwaterloo.ca [129.97.140.24]
The uwaterloo archive includes tech reports from the Logic Programming
and Artificial Intelligence Group (LPAIG) of the University of Waterloo.

There is also a WAIS server containing tech report abstracts that can be
searched. To use, create the file ~/wais-sources/cs-techreport-abstracts.src 
containing
   (:source
      :version  3
      :ip-address "130.194.74.201"
      :ip-name "daneel.rdt.monash.edu.au"
      :tcp-port 210

      :cost 0.00
      :cost-unit :free
      :maintainer "wais@daneel.rdt.monash.edu.au")
and invoke your local wais client. To add to it, email abstracts of
your papers to wais@rdt.monash.edu.au in the following format:
   %TI Title
   %AU Author (use multiple %AU lines for multiple authors)
   %PU Published In (citation information)
   %AV Availability (e.g., ftp reports.adm.cs.cmu.edu:/1992/CMU-CS-92-101.ps)
   %OR Organization (see cs-techreport-archives.src for institution codes)
   %LT Local title (e.g., tech report number)
   %DA Date (and, if you want, %MN Month, %YR Year)
   %AB Abstract
If your papers are not available by FTP, you can use a %AV line such as:
   %AV mail harry.bovik@cs.cmu.edu

Subject: [6-3] Where can I get a machine readable dictionary, thesaurus, and
               other text corpora?

Free:

   /usr/dict/words

   Roget's 1911 Thesaurus is available by anonymous FTP from the
   Consortium for Lexical Research 
      clr.nmsu.edu:/CLR/lexica/roget-1911 [128.123.1.12]
   It is also available from
      src.doc.ic.ac.uk:/literary/collections/project_gutenberg/roget11.txt.Z
   An old Webster's dictionary is in /text/dict/{DICT.Z,DICT.INDEX.Z}.
   Project Gutenberg also has Roget's 1911 Thesaurus. The Project
   Gutenberg archive is at mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu:/pub/etext/. The
   Project Gutenberg archive collects public domain electronic books. For more
   information, write to Michael S. Hart, Professor of Electronic Text,
   Executive Director of Project Gutenberg Etext, Illinois Benedictine
   College, 5700 College Road, Lisle, IL 60532 or send email to
   hart@vmd.cso.uiuc.edu. 

   For people without FTP, Austin Code Works sells floppy disks
   containing Roget's 1911 Thesaurus for $40.00. This money helps support
   the production of other useful texts, such as the 1913 Webster's dictionary.

   The Online Book Initiative maintains a text repository on
   ftp.std.com (a public access UNIX system, 617-739-WRLD). See the
   README file on obi.std.com:/obi/. For more information, send email to
   obi@world.std.com, write to Software Tool & Die, 1330 Beacon Street,
   Brookline, MA 02146, or call 617-739-0202.

   The CHILDES project at Carnegie Mellon University has a lot of data of
   children speaking to adults, as well as the adult written and adult
   spoken corpora from the CORNELL project.  Contact Brian MacWhinney

   A list of 110,000 English words (one per line, in ASCII) is
   available in the PD1:<MSDOS.LINGUISTICS> directory on SIMTEL20 as the
   files WORDS1.ZIP, WORDS2.ZIP, WORDS3.ZIP, and WORDS4.ZIP. Although the
   list is in MS-DOS files, it can easily be used on other machines (but
   first you'll have to unzip the files on a DOS machine). The list
   includes inflected forms of the words, such as plural nouns and the
   -s, -ed, and -ing forms of verbs; thus the number of lexical stems in
   the list is considerably smaller than the total number of word forms.
   These files are available via FTP from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL
   [192.88.110.20].  SIMTEL20 files are mirrored on wuarchive.wustl.edu.

Subject: [6-5] AI-related CD-ROMs

Prime Time Freeware for AI:

   Prime Time Freeware for AI is an annual CD-ROM collection of
   Artificial Intelligence freeware source code and documentation. Prime
   Time Freeware for AI in no way modifies the legal restrictions on any
   package it includes.  Each issue consists of two ISO-9660 CD-ROMs,
   bound into a 224 page book.

   The current issue (1-1; July 1994) includes a selection of the
   contents of the CMU AI Repository (see [5-1]), including most of the
   AI Programming Languages section and most of the AI Software Packages
   section. Thus the CD-ROMs contain nearly every free implementation of
   Lisp, Prolog, Scheme, and Smalltalk, including graphical user
   interfaces, object-oriented programming extensions, and other software
   development tools.
		      
   They also contain the most complete collection of free software in 
   every area of artificial intelligence research and practice, including 
   Artificial Life, Expert Systems, Fuzzy Logic, Genetic Algorithms,
   Knowledge Representation, Machine Learning, Natural Language 
   Understanding and Generation, Neural Networks, Planning, Reasoning, 
   Speech Recognition and Synthesis, and Theorem Proving, and much, much more.
				 
   All of the more than 1,300 packages are extensively annotated and
   indexed, with programs for searching the index included on the CDs.
   Since the CD-ROMs use gzip for compression, this means that Prime
   Time Freeware for AI contains more than 5,000 megabytes of
   AI-related software.  

   Prime Time Freeware for AI is targeted at AI researchers, educators,
   students, and practitioners.  Prime Time Freeware for AI is
   particularly useful for programmers who do not have FTP access, but
   may also be useful as a way of saving disk space and avoiding annoying
   FTP searches and retrievals.
				
   Prime Time Freeware helped establish the CMU AI Repository, and sales
   of Prime Time Freeware for AI will continue to help support the
   expansion and maintenance of the repository. The product sells (list)
   for $60 US plus applicable sales tax and shipping and handling
   charges. Payable through Visa, Mastercard, postal money orders in US
   funds, and checks in US funds drawn on a US bank. Thus Prime Time
   Freeware for AI offers more than twice the contents of the NCC AI
   CD-ROM. For more information write to

   tutorials and other files for a variety of operating systems. Among the
   supported operating systems are DOS, OS/2, Mac, Amiga, and Unix. Among
   the items included are the latest version NASA software such as CLIPS v6,
   NETS, and SPLICER, the collected source code from AIExpert magazine from
   the premier issue in June of 1986 to the present, and complete 
   transcriptions of the first annual Loebner Prize competition. It also
   includes examples many different kinds of neural networks, genetic
   algorithms, artificial life simulators, natural language software,
   public domain and shareware compilers for a wide range of languages
   such as Lisp, Xlisp, Scheme, XScheme, Smalltalk, Prolog, ICON, SNOBOL,
   and many others. Complete collections of the Neural Digest, Genetic
   Algorithms Digest, and Vision List Digest are included. Most files on
   the disk are compressed in ZIP format. Macintosh specific files are 
   in BinHex v4 (.HQX) format. Network Cybernetics Corporation releases annual
   revisions to the AI CD-ROM to keep it up to date with current developments
   in the field. For more information, write to Network Cybernetics

Subject: [6-6] World-Wide Web (WWW) Resources

The World Wide Web (WWW) is a hypermedia document that spans the
Internet.  It uses the http (HyperText Transfer Protocol) for the
light-weight exchange of files over the Internet.  NCSA Mosaic is a
World Wide Web browser developed at the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). 

Mosaic's popularity derives, in part, from its ability to communicate
using more traditional Internet protocols like FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and
NNTP, in addition to http. Mosaic can display text, hypertext links,
and inlined graphics directly. When Mosaic encounters a file type it
can't handle internally, such as Postscript documents, mpeg movies,
sound files, and JPEG images, it uses an external viewer (or player)
like Ghostscript to handle the file. Mosaic also includes facilities
for exploring the Internet. In other words, Mosaic is an multimedia
interface to the Internet.

The hypertext documents viewed with Mosaic are written in HTML
(HyperText Markup Language), which is a subset of SGML (Standard
Generalized Markup Language).  All that is needed is just a few more
improvements, such as the ability to format tables and mathematics,
and a WYSIWYG editor, for HTML to greatly facilitate electronic
journals and other publications.

NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System is available by anonymous ftp from  
   ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu:/Mosaic/
as source code and binaries for Sun, SGI, IBM RS/6000, DEC Alpha OSF/1, DEC
Ultrix, and HP-UX. Questions about NCSA Mosaic should be directed to 
mosaic-x@ncsa.uiuc.edu (X-Windows version), mosaic-mac@ncsa.uiuc.edu
(Macintosh), and mosaic-win@ncsa.uiuc.edu (Microsoft Windows).

If you do not have a WWW client like Mosaic, you can search the WWW by
telnet to info.cern.ch. There is also an email interface; to use it,
send mail to listproc@www-0.cern.ch, and use lines like
   www http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/AI/html/faqs/top.html
to retrieve the text of a particular URL (in this case, the AI FAQs page).

The remainder of this section lists WWW resources of interest to AI
researchers, students, and practitioners. Other URLs are scattered
throughout the FAQ. If the entry includes an email address, that is
the email address to which suggestions for additional links should be
sent. 

AI-related FAQ Postings:

   A simple HTML version of the AI FAQ (this FAQ) and several other
   AI-related FAQs is available as
      http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/AI/html/faqs/top.html
   or equivalently,
      http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/html/faqs/top.html
   It is prepared automatically from the original once a week and
   ftp sites, gopher, and other WWW references in the text are

Genetic Art and Movies:

   Programs which use genetic algorithms to create art, inspired by the
   work of Karl Sims at Thinking Machines. Votes from human users (folks
   like you) are used to determine the "fitness" of the pictures in the
   current generation. The more fit pictures are more likely to be used
   in the creation of the next generation. After about a dozen or so
   generations, really pretty pictures result.
