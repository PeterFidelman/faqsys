# faqsys
A mirror of the [FAQSYS programming reference](http://www.phatcode.net/articles.php?id=235).

While FAQSYS has existed for many years, there is no stable Internet-facing mirror (that I know of), so the information has been relatively inaccessible.  This repo is an attempt to fix that.

FAQSYS contains such information as:
* How to interact with the hardware found in a typical 80s-90s PC compatible.
* Descriptions of various graphics/sound/... algorithms written to be accessible to a lay audience.
* Descriptions of various file formats.

All credit belongs to the original authors.  I'm just a librarian.
